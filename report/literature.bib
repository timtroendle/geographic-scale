  abstract = {Abstract Whilst the existence of global climate change is no longer seriously contested and most governments are seeking to adopt appropriate responses, the rate of engagement with these measures is slow. Top-down policies and reliance on market mechanisms are failing to produce the reductions in energy demand and shifts away from fossil fuel reliance that are required. This paper outlines an example of a research programme that seeks to deliver more rapid change. It focuses on the potential for carbon emission reduction in a deprived community in South Yorkshire, UK, and reports on an approach that could be replicated elsewhere. The method includes estimation of baseline energy demand, energy efficiency potential and renewable energy resource assessment as a precursor to action. An innovative community-based energy service company is described and the benefits of a community-based bottom-up approach to carbon reduction are outlined.},

Eine vollständige Umstellung auf erneuerbare Energien ist möglich. Wer sie nicht unverzüglich in Angriff nimmt, handelt unverantwortlich und beschwört neue Krisen herauf.

The nature of community energy and the role that such initiatives might play in the general fabric of civic life is not, however, well understood. Community energy initiatives might involve only those citizens who prefer to be actively and continuously involved in intense, democratic debate. A more robust conceptualization of community energy might, on the other hand, be guided by Benjamin Barber’s notion of “strong democracy,” in which community energy initiatives would draw upon a much broader citizen base, involving people from many walks of life and from quarters not generally presumed to be part of a sustained democratic process. The history of community energy is explored and a number of case studies are presented to illustrate the problems, prospects, and limitations of a socially and technologically decentralized energy system.},

  abstract = {The residual load and excess power generation of 30 European countries with a 100\% penetration of variable renewable energy sources are explored in order to quantify the benefit of power transmission between countries. Estimates are based on extensive weather data, which allows for modelling of hourly mismatches between the demand and renewable generation from wind and solar photovoltaics. For separated countries, balancing is required to cover around 24\% of the total annual electricity consumption. This number can be reduced down to 15\% once all countries are networked together with unconstrained interconnectors. The reduction represents the maximum possible benefit of transmission for the countries. The total Net Transfer Capacity of the unconstrained interconnectors is roughly 11.5 times larger than current values. However, constrained interconnector capacities 5.7 times larger than the current values are found to provide 98\% of the maximum possible benefit of transmission. This motivates a detailed investigation of several constrained transmission capacity layouts to determine the export and import capabilities of countries participating in a fully renewable European electricity system.},

However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly proven. This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing NASA's MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50\% in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30\% in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2\%, with countries ranging from 19.5\% (Germany) to 32.4\% (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23\% more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3\%. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4\% and Germany's to 29.1\%.},

GPWv4 is a minimally modeled data set that uses uniform distribution to disaggregate census data from their native input units into a thirty arc-second global grid. Due to an increase in freely accessible census data from the 2010 round of censuses, eighty-seven countries are gridded at a higher administrative level than in the previous version, with a more than fivefold increase in the total number of census units outside of the United States. The resultant decrease in unit size has greatly improved the data set accuracy. Additionally, version 4 has expanded to include grids of age, sex, and urban–rural status.

  title = {Renewable energy based electricity supply at low costs - Development of the REMix model and application for Europe},
  url = {http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2012/7635/index.html},
  abstract = {Climate change, limited fossil fuel availability and the dependency on energy carrier imports lead the European Union to the formulation of an energy policy for Europe. The EU sets the following criteria for its future energy supply: sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness. Considering the carbon dioxide emissions of fossil fuels and the unsolved problem of the ultimate disposal of radioactive waste, only renewable energy can currently be considered sustainable if applied in a socially acceptable way and in accordance with nature conservation. The use of renewable energy can also reduce the dependency on energy carrier imports. Contrary to fossil fuels, renewable energy will become cheaper in the future due to technological learning. 
The main disadvantage of some renewable energy resources is their fluctuating availability. Adaptation of the energy supply system must take place especially in the power sector in order to reliably cover fluctuating demand with fluctuating resources at any time. In this work, the energy system model ‘REMix’ (Renewable Energy Mix for Sustainable Electricity Supply) is developed. It uses data on the availability of renewable energy across Europe and North Africa (EUNA) to dimension low-cost power supply structures for the EUNA-region, or parts of it, under specific conditions, such as specified shares of renewable energy in the power supply or specified national self-supply shares. The model takes into account the costs of generation technologies, transmission lines and storage units, and finds a combination of these technologies and their geographic locations that is least-cost under the given assumptions.
A geographic information system was used for the analysis of the installable capacities and power generation potentials of typical technologies for harnessing renewable energy resources. This analysis is described and the potentials of solar PV, solar CSP, wind onshore and wind offshore, biomass, hydro and geothermal power plants are shown in tables and maps. The data are used as input into a linear programming energy system model which uses them as constraints on the power supply system to be dimensioned. The model, its sensitivity to input parameter variations and a test application are described. 
The findings confirm the basic findings of other work in this field: transmission lines can be a crucial element of a low-cost, renewable-energy-based electricity supply because they enable balancing effects in a large grid and the use of the highest quality resources even in remote areas, such as deserts or at sea. However, the international cooperation that is necessary to reach the cost-minimum for a given supply task may not be reached by politics or resulting dependencies may be opposed to political goals. Therefore, REMix was built such that countries can be examined individually and the influence of different parameters on their energy supply costs and structure can be investigated. In the test model application, power supply systems for 36 regions in Europe and North Africa, almost all individual countries, are designed with REMix as island grids on the one hand and on the other hand as a network without transmission restrictions (other than the costs of the transmission lines). The model shows that in certain regions the island grid electricity costs can be much higher than, only a little higher than, or even lower than the electricity costs in the network, under the given technological and economic assumptions. The sensitivity to parameter variations is shown to be high; the results of the test application must therefore be considered one example of a technically feasible and efficient supply system but cannot claim to be least-cost in general.},

  abstract = {National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: eLOAD (electricity LOad curve ADjustment) and DESSTinEE (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23\% points above the change in annual demand, to 103~GW in Germany and 92~GW in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5~GW to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn.},

Seven large-scale energy-economy models, namely PRIMES, TIMES-PanEu, GEM-E3, NEMESIS, WorldScan, Green-X and GAINS, which have been extensively used in EU climate and energy policy analysis are employed for the simulation and quantification of alternative EU decarbonisation pathways under technological limitations and climate policy delays. The multi-model perspective provides valuable insights for the formulation of robust policies. The model results show that the EU emissions reduction target is feasible with currently known technological options at low costs (lower than 1\% of GDP in the period 2015–2050). Models confirm the EU Roadmap priorities for 2050 with regard to accelerated energy efficiency, transport electrification and supply-side restructuring with high RES, CCS and nuclear deployment. Decarbonisation targets are found feasible even in cases with technological limitations regarding CCS and nuclear technologies and delays in transport electrification albeit with higher costs. Delaying emission reduction action until 2030 has significant adverse effects on energy system costs and stresses the system capabilities for decarbonisation.},

The empirical data for this study is based on insights generated through expert interviews (N =19) with mayors, energy experts and scientists as well as a quantitative study among mayors and energy officers (N =109) of German municipalities. Results show that environmental awareness, tax revenues and greater independence from private utilities are positively related to the mayors’ attitude towards the realization of energy self-sufficiency. Furthermore, citizens, the political environment, the mayor's political power, and his/her financial resources are relevant factors for a municipality striving for energy self-sufficiency. Policymakers need to decide whether or not to support mayors in this development. For suitable policy interventions, the results suggest the importance of an integrated approach that considers a combination of identified factors. Finally, we propose a morphological box to structure different aspects of energy self-sufficiency and categorize the present study.},

The application of the global water model WaterGAP for discharge calculations allows for an integrated assessment, taking both climate and socioeconomic changes into account. This study comprises two key parts: First, the ‘gross’ hydropower potential is analyzed, in order to outline the general distribution and trends in hydropower capabilities across Europe. Then, the assessment focuses on the ‘developed’ hydropower potential of existing hydropower plants, in order to allow for a more realistic picture of present and future electricity production. For the second part, a new data set has been developed which geo-references 5991 European hydropower stations and distinguishes them into run-of-river and reservoir stations. The results of this study present strong indications that, following moderate climate and global change scenario assumptions, severe future alterations in discharge regimes have to be expected, leading to unstable regional trends in hydropower potentials with reductions of 25\% and more for southern and southeastern European countries.},

To enable advanced assessments of the role and effects of dams within the global river network and to support strategies for mitigating ecohydrological and socioeconomic costs, we introduce here the spatially explicit and hydrologically linked Global Reservoir and Dam database (GRanD). As of early 2011, GRanD contains information regarding 6862 dams and their associated reservoirs, with a total storage capacity of 6197 km3. On the basis of these records, we estimate that about 16.7 million reservoirs larger than 0.01 ha – with a combined storage capacity of approximately 8070 km3 – may exist worldwide, increasing Earth's terrestrial surface water area by more than 305 000 km2. We find that 575 900 river kilometers, or 7.6\% of the world's rivers with average flows above 1 cubic meter per second (m3 s−1), are affected by a cumulative upstream reservoir capacity that exceeds 2\% of their annual flow; the impact is highest for large rivers with average flows above 1000 m3 s−1, of which 46.7\% are affected. Finally, a sensitivity analysis suggests that smaller reservoirs have substantial impacts on the spatial extent of flow alterations despite their minor role in total reservoir capacity.},

  abstract = {Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented.},

  abstract = {Flexibility is the ability of a power system to respond to changes in power demand and generation. Integrating large shares of variable renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar, can lead to a strong increase of flexibility requirements for the complementary system, traditionally hydrothermal, which has to balance the fluctuations of variable generation. We quantify these flexibility requirements at the operational timescale of 1–12~hours and different spatial scales across Europe. Our results indicate that three major factors determine the ramping flexibility needed in future power systems: the penetration of variable renewables, their mix and the geographic system size. Compared to the variability of load, flexibility requirements increase strongly in systems with combined wind and PV (photovoltaics) contribution of more than 30\% of total energy and a share of PV in the renewables mix above 20–30\%. In terms of extreme ramps, the flexibility requirements of a geographically large, transnational power system are significantly lower than of smaller regional systems, especially at high wind penetration.},

  abstract = {Detailed information about the potential and costs of renewable energies is an important input for energy system models as well as for commercial and political decision-making processes. Especially wind energy with its increasing locally installed capacity and hub heights plays an important role when it comes to meeting climate targets and optimizing electricity networks. Recently however, wind energy has faced more and more social barriers and land use constraints which can negatively impact both political goals and investment decisions. Therefore this work presents a bottom-up methodology to estimate these effects by calculating the feasible potential and the associated costs for the German federal state of Baden-Württemberg as a case study. Landscape aesthetical aspects are considered and an algorithm applied based on graph-theoretical considerations to include spatial planning rules such as separation distances between wind farms. By means of spatially high-resolution land use data and techno-economic parameters, possible wind turbines are placed considering wind direction and variable spacing between turbines. In a further step, possible farm sites are located and assessed, and the result is presented in the form of cost-potential curves. The feasible potential is found to be between a third and a half of the technical potential and is between 11.8 and 29.1~TWh, with costs between 6.7 and 12.6~€ct/kWh. In addition, a substantial spatial shift in the location of future wind energy production can be observed when wind farm spacing is taken into account. The quality of the algorithm is tested against already existing wind farms and areas that are approved by regional authorities for the use of wind energy, and a very good correlation is observed. The focus in future work should lie on the development of an economic criterion that, unlike the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), is able to account for the system costs of a widespread wind energy development, including network expansion, balancing power and reserve energy costs. Further, visibility analysis could be implemented using digital elevation models to consider the topography for optimal wind farm spacing.},

  abstract = {We use the model DIETER, introduced in a companion paper, to analyze the role of power storage in systems with high shares of variable renewable energy sources. The model captures multiple system values of power storage related to arbitrage, capacity, and reserve provision. We apply the model to a greenfield setting that is loosely calibrated to the German power system, but may be considered as a more generic case of a thermal power system with increasing shares of variable renewables. In a baseline scenario, we find that power storage requirements remain moderate up to a renewable share of around 80\%, as other options on both the supply and demand side may also offer flexibility at low cost. Yet storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves. If the renewable share further increases to 100\%, the need for power storage grows substantially. As long-run parameter assumptions are highly uncertain, we carry out a range of sensitivity analyses. As a general finding, storage requirements strongly depend on the costs and availabilities of other flexibility options, particularly regarding flexible power generation from biomass. We conclude that power storage becomes an increasingly important element of a transition toward a fully renewable-based power system, and gains further relevance if other potential sources of flexibility are limited.},

  abstract = {To reach ambitious European CO2 emission reduction targets, most scenarios of future European electricity systems rely on large shares of wind and solar photovoltaic power generation. We interpolate between two concepts for balancing the variability of these renewable sources: balancing at continental scales using the transmission grid and balancing locally with storage. This interpolation is done by systematically restricting transmission capacities from the optimum level to zero. We run techno-economic cost optimizations for the capacity investment and dispatch of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural gas power generation and transmission, as well as storage options such as pumped-hydro, battery, and hydrogen storage. The simulations assume a 95\% CO2 emission reduction compared to 1990, and are run over a full historical year of weather and electricity demand for 30 European countries. In the cost-optimal system with high levels of transmission expansion, energy generation is dominated by wind (65\%) and hydro (15\%), with average system costs comparable to today's system. Restricting transmission shifts the balance in favour of solar and storage, driving up costs by a third. As the restriction is relaxed, 85\% of the cost benefits of the optimal grid expansion can be captured already with only 44\% of the transmission volume.},

We found that these projects collectively involved \$820 billion worth of investment, and represented more than 325,000MW of installed capacity and 8500km of transmission lines. Taken together, these projects incurred \$388 billion in cost overruns, equivalent to a mean cost escalation of \$968 million per project, or a 66.3 percent overrun per project. In this article, we extend upon that earlier analysis to explain how hydroelectric dams, nuclear reactors, wind farms, solar facilities, fossil fueled thermal plants, and transmission lines pose distinct construction risks. We highlight that electricity infrastructure is prone to cost overrun issues almost independently of technology or location, that hydroelectric dams and nuclear reactors have the greatest amount and frequency of cost overruns, even when normalized to overrun per installed MW, and that solar and wind projects seem to present the least construction risk. Consequently, investors, electric utilities, public officials, and energy analysts need to rethink and reevaluate the methodologies they use to predict construction timetables and calculate budgets.},

Unfortunately, land eligibility (LE) investigations in the literature are plagued by many inconsistencies between studies, impeding the work of researchers and policy makers interested in energy system development planning. As one factor contributing to this, the criteria used to construct land exclusion constraints have not been the focus of scientific investigation on a large scale, and as such their interactions are not well known.Therefore, an open source LE framework was used to perform evaluations in the European context of 36 commonly used constraints. After direct visualization, three measures by which these constraints are valuable to an LE analysis were computed: independence, exclusivity, and overlap. Results show extensive spatial sensitivity to constrain influence. Furthermore, some constraints, such as proximity to agriculture and woodland areas, rank high in all three measures; others, such as distance from airports and camping sites, consistently rank low; and still others, such as elevation, score highly in one measure but not the others. With these results, LE researchers can better understand the contributions of the constraints used in their analyses.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the geological resource potential of the compressed air energy storage (CAES) technology worldwide by overlaying suitable geological formations, salt deposits and aquifers. For this study, the world is divided into 145 regions, which are aggregated to 9 major regions. The potential of CAES in each region is assessed and a relevant map is provided. Three constraints have been implemented, allowing for 1\%, 5\% and 10\% of the selected area to be considered for CAES. Among all major regions, in the most conservative constraint (1\% of the total area), North America is the leader with 0.26\% suitability of its total area, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa and South America at 0.20\% and 0.19\%, respectively. A sensitivity analysis is implemented to evaluate the validity and reliability of the results. Three scenarios are considered: Optimistic, Moderate and Pessimistic. Underground natural gas storage data for the US is used due to freely and publicly available data. The natural gas storage site is assumed to have the same structure as CAES. The sensitivity analysis shows that the accuracy of the findings lie in the range of 66–85\% and 63–82\%, depending on the scenarios and reservoir types. The results clearly reveal that CAES is a promising energy storage technology for electricity supply in most of the regions.

  abstract = {At first blush, Earth appears to have power to spare. The total power from sunlight striking the ground is a whopping 101,000 terawatts, and experts estimate that we could capture enough of that to exceed by a wide margin the 15 terawatts of power that the world's population now consumes. But sunshine and other forms of renewable energy such as wind deliver energy in a far less dense form than coal, oil, or natural gas. Another issue: The sun doesn't necessarily shine the brightest and the wind doesn't blow the fiercest where most people live. And technologies have yet to emerge to store and transport vast amounts of energy generated from sunshine or wind. The energy problem is also a water problem. Electricity from solar thermal technologies uses 68\% more water than electricity from coal. Use power from biomass crops and you'll also use hundreds of liters of water to grow the fuel.

Rund 13,8 Prozent der deutschen Landesfläche lassen sich nach einer neuen Studie des Umweltbundesamtes (UBA) für die Windenergie nutzen - ohne sensible Naturräume zu beeinträchtigen oder Abstriche beim gesetzlichen Lärmschutz zu machen. Möglich wäre demnach eine installierte Windenergieleistung von bis zu 1.200 Gigawatt (GW). Derzeit sind an Land rund 30 GW Windenergie installiert, die bereits acht Prozent des deutschen Stroms liefern. Das zeigt: „Grundsätzlich ist für den Ausbau der Windenergie an Land viel mehr Platz vorhanden, als wir praktisch brauchen, selbst dann wenn man innerhalb des Erneuerbaren-Energiemixes den Anteil der Windenergienutzung an Land vergrößert. Wir müssen das immense Potenzial nur zu einem kleinen Teil ausschöpfen, um unsere Klimaziele zu erreichen. Bundesweit betrachtet besteht damit ein großer Gestaltungsspielraum für den Ausbau der Windenergie an Land und für den künftigen erneuerbaren Energiemix insgesamt,“ sagte UBA-Präsident Jochen Flasbarth. In diesem Energiemix spiele die Windenergie auf See weiter eine wichtige Rolle.},

  abstract = {In Germany the introduction of a feed-in tariff for renewable energies in the year 2000 led to a massive increase in newly constructed photovoltaic (PV) plants reaching a total installed capacity of 35GWp as of November 30th, 2013. The distribution of these plants shows a large disparity between regions, which motivates investigations of regional potentials which earlier studies of Germany have not addressed in detail. This study presents a high-resolution calculation for the technical potential of residential-roof-mounted photovoltaic systems for each municipality in Germany. Electricity load curves for municipalities were generated based on the socio-economic structure and used to draw generalized conclusions about the relationship between the (potential) supply from PV and the local demand. The total German residential-roof-mounted technical PV potential was determined as 148TWh/a with an installable capacity of 208GWp. About 30\% of municipalities could become autonomous based on a yearly balance of PV electricity generation. If the daily and seasonal variations in demand and PV electricity generation were considered, only 53 of the 11,593 German municipalities could become autonomous, provided they installed a short-term storage system which would have to be sized around 57\% of their daily electricity demand. Imposing the restriction that no feedback of electricity into the distribution network outside the municipality should occur, and assuming that no local storage exists, around 49\% of the total technical potential, i.e. 103GWp could be installed (i.e. 90GWp additional potential since some municipalities already experience feedbacks into the distribution network). A validation of the results with municipal solar cadastres has shown that the discrepancy between them and the technical potential calculated in this study is quite consistently about 30\%, which is assumed to be due to non-residential buildings not being considered here. The calculated technical potential is most sensitive to the assumptions on the module efficiency and the usable area of (slanted) roofs. A validation of building data assumptions as well as a comparison with other studies both show a good agreement.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a theoretical study on the optimum tilt angle for flat plate collectors at different geographical locations and different time moments over a year. The solar radiation density is estimated based on three analysis models, namely Hottel and Woertz model (the simplest), Isotropic diffuse model (Liu \& Jordan model) and HDKR model (Hay–Davis–Klucker–Reindl), passing from the simplest to the most complex one. Further, the absorbed solar radiation density is computed and the optimum tilt angle is found for different geographical locations (covering the Globe latitudes). The optimum value for the tilt angle is researched for maximum incident solar radiation and also for maximum absorbed one. The results indicate that the same angle is obtained when looking for maximum incident and for maximum absorbed solar radiation. When comparing the three above mentioned models, different tilt angles are supplied by applying the Hottel and Woertz model and respectively the others two (both of them providing the same angle). Although, the predicted absorbed solar radiation is the same in the summertime for all three models, and probably overestimated by the last model in the springtime. The obtained results give an overview over the whole year operation at different geographical latitudes. When using the Hottel \& Woertz model for estimating the incident solar radiation, the optimum tilt angle for a flat plate collector should be computed as simplest as βopt=φ−δ function on the latitude and declination. If a fixed value is easier to be used over a specific operation period, an optimum value is provided by this research. The novelty consists in finding this global optimum instead of “local” ones for which monthly adjustment is required. The results are compared to the approximation given in the technical literature according to which the optimum tilt angle should be local latitude plus or minus (for winter or summer seasons, respectively) 10° or 15° (with small variations as it is further presented).},

  abstract = {This study provides estimates of photovoltaic (PV) panel optimal tilt angles for all countries worldwide. It then estimates the incident solar radiation normal to either tracked or optimally tilted panels relative to horizontal panels globally. Optimal tilts are derived from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s PVWatts program. A simple 3rd-order polynomial fit of optimal tilt versus latitude is derived. The fit matches data better above 40° N latitude than do previous linear fits. Optimal tilts are then used in the global 3-D GATOR-GCMOM model to estimate annual ratios of incident radiation normal to optimally tilted, 1-axis vertically tracked (swiveling vertically around a horizontal axis), 1-axis horizontally tracked (at optimal tilt and swiveling horizontally around a vertical axis), and 2-axis tracked panels relative to horizontal panels in 2050. Globally- and annually-averaged, these ratios are ∼1.19, ∼1.22, ∼1.35, and ∼1.39, respectively. 1-axis horizontal tracking differs from 2-axis tracking, annually averaged, by only 1–3\% at most all latitudes. 1-axis horizontal tracking provides much more output than 1-axis vertical tracking below 65° N and S, whereas output is similar elsewhere. Tracking provides little benefit over optimal tilting above 75° N and 60° S. Tilting and tracking benefits generally increase with increasing latitude. In fact, annually averaged, more sunlight reach tilted or tracked panels from 80 to 90° S than any other latitude. Tilting and tracking benefit cities of the same latitude with lesser aerosol and cloud cover. In sum, for optimal utility PV output, 1-axis horizontal tracking is recommended, except for the highest latitudes, where optimal tilting is sufficient. However, decisions about panel configuration also require knowing tracking equipment and land costs, which are not evaluated here. Installers should also calculate optimal tilt angles for their location for more accuracy. Models that ignore optimal tilting for rooftop PV and utility PV tracking may underestimate significantly country or world PV potential.},

  abstract = {The ongoing rush of the UE member states to the 2020 overall targets on the national renewable energy share (see Directive 2009/28/EC), is propelling the large exploitation of the solar resource for the electricity production. However, the incentives to the large employment of PV solar modules and the relative perspective profits, are often cause of massive ground-mounted installations. These kind of installations are obviously the preferred solution by the investors for their high economic yields, but their social impact should be also considered. Over the Piedmont Region for instance, the large proliferation of PV farms is jeopardising wide agricultural terrains and turistic areas, therefore the policy of the actual administration is to encourage the use of integrated systems in place of massive installations. For these reasons, an effort to demonstrate that the distributed residential generation can play a primary role in the market is mandatory. In our previous work “Scalable methodology for the photovoltaic solar energy potential assessment based on available roof surface area: application to Piedmont Region (Italy)”, we already proposed a basic methodology for the evaluation of the roof-top PV system potential. However, despite the total roof surface has been computed on a given cartographical dataset, the real roof surface available for PV installations has been evaluated through the assumption of representative roofing typologies and empirical coefficients found via visual inspection of satellite images. In order to overcome this arbitrariness and refine our methodology, in the present paper we present a brand new algorithm to compute the available roof surface, based on the systematical analysis and processing of aerial georeferenced images (ortho-images). The algorithm, fully developed in MATLAB®, accounts for shadow, roof surface available (bright and not), roof features (i.e. chimneys or walls) and azimuthal angle of the eventual installation. Here we apply the algorithm to the whole city of Turin, and process more than 60,000 buildings. The results achieved are finally compared with our previous work and the updated PV potential assessment is consequently discussed.},

It is shown that for a low PV penetration (about 10\% of total roof area) the PV potential can be well estimated by considering no shade and local optimum inclination and orientation. For high PV penetration (i.e. covering all roof area available) the PV potential can be well estimated by considering a horizontal surface with the footprint area of the buildings. These results suggest a simple first-approximation estimation of the PV potential of an urban area without the need for a full 3D analysis of mutual shading on a Surface Digital Model.},

This includes installations on roof or facade surfaces with orientations that are not ideal for maximum energy production. To evaluate the performance of PV systems in urban settings and compare it with the building user’s electricity consumption, three-dimensional geometry modelling was combined with photovoltaic system simulations. As an example, the modern residential district of Scharnhauser Park (SHP) near Stuttgart/Germany was used to calculate the potential of photovoltaic energy and to evaluate the local own consumption of the energy produced. For most buildings of the district only annual electrical consumption data was available and only selected buildings have electronic metering equipment. The available roof area for one of these multi-family case study buildings was used for a detailed hourly simulation of the PV power production, which was then compared to the hourly measured electricity consumption. The results were extrapolated to all buildings of the analyzed area by normalizing them to the annual consumption data. The PV systems can produce 35\% of the quarter’s total electricity consumption and half of this generated electricity is directly used within the buildings.},

In urban areas, solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment on existing rooftops is one of the most viable sustainable energy resources. The present study uses a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and geographic information systems (GIS) to estimate the rooftop solar PV potential for the urban areas at the commune level (the smallest administrative division) in Switzerland. The rooftop solar PV potential for a total 1901 out of 2477 communes in Switzerland is estimated. Following a 6-fold cross validation, the root-mean-square error (also normalized) is used to estimate the accuracy of the different SVM models. The results show that, on average, 81\% of the total ground floor area of each building corresponds to the available roof area for the PV installation. Also considering the total available roof area for PV installation, that is, 328km2 and roof orientations within ±90° of due south, the annual potential PV electricity production for the urban areas in Switzerland is estimated at 17.86TWh (assumed 17\% efficiency and 80\% performance ratio). This amount corresponds to 28\% of Switzerland’s electricity consumption in 2015.},

  abstract = {An estimate of solar irradiation potential over large regions requires the knowledge of the long-term spatio-temporal distribution of the solar radiation as well as the identification of the suitable surfaces where the photovoltaic (PV) installations can be built. These main components can be modelled in different ways and are thus affected by different sources of uncertainty. Thus, when estimating the exploitable potential over large regions, it is important to measure the accuracy of the entire process. In this work, we provide a generic method to estimate the solar irradiation potential of rooftops over large regions and an estimate of the corresponding uncertainties when calculating the long-term electricity generation of PV plants. This method uses satellite based solar radiation data covering a period of 22 years, with a temporal resolution of 30 min and a spatial resolution of 3.8–5.6 km. Suitable surfaces on rooftops are identified using Digital Surface Models combined with building footprints. This allows to determine the geometry of rooftops, such as slope, and orientation with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. Finally, we calculated the electricity generation based on models which take into account all characteristics of PV system components. In order to estimate the accuracy of the model for electricity production, we compared the monthly generation of 500 PV plants in Switzerland consisting of different PV technologies (mono-crystalline, poly-crystalline and thin film) with the estimates. The validation results show a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9 and a median monthly relative error between 0.28\% (August) and 28.08\% (December). The monthly estimates are more accurate during summer time, while spatially and technology-wise no significant differences are found.},

The database, with a resolution of 1km×1km, consists of monthly and yearly averages of global irradiation and related climatic parameters, representing the period 1981–1990. The database has been used to analyse regional and national differences of solar energy resource and to assess the photovoltaic (PV) potential in the 25 European Union member states and 5 candidate countries. The calculation of electricity generation potential by contemporary PV technology is a basic step in analysing scenarios for the future energy supply and for a rational implementation of legal and financial frameworks to support the developing industrial production of PV. Three aspects are explored within this paper: (1) the expected average annual electricity generation of a ‘standard’ 1kWp grid-connected PV system; (2) the theoretical potential of PV electricity generation; (3) determination of required installed capacity for each country to supply 1\% of the national electricity consumption from PV. The analysis shows that PV can already provide a significant contribution to a mixed renewable energy portfolio in the present and future European Union.},

Given the negative environmental impacts (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions) that accompany their use, it is hardly surprising that the development of renewable energies has become a major priority in the world today. Andalusia, with a mean solar radiation of 4.75kWh/m2 per day and a surface area of 87,597km2, is the region in Europe with the highest solar energy potential. This research study determined the solar energy potential in Andalusia for grid-connected photovoltaic systems installed on residential rooftops. A methodology was developed for this purpose, which first involved a description of building characteristics, followed by the calculation of the useful roof surface area where photovoltaic arrays could be installed. In the next phase of the study, the mean solar irradiation characteristics were defined as well as the technical parameters of the photovoltaic systems. All of these factors allowed us to estimate the amount of electricity that could be potentially generated per year by solar panels.},

  abstract = {The potential of on-shore wind energy in Spain is assessed using a methodology based on a detailed characterization of the wind resource. To obtain such a characterization, high-resolution simulations of the weather in Spain during 1 year are performed, and the wind statistics thus gathered are used to estimate the electricity-generation potential. The study reports also the evolution with the installed power of the capacity factor, a parameter closely related to the cost of the generated energy, as well as the occupied land, which bears environmental and social acceptance implications. A parametric study is performed to assess the uncertainties in the study associated to the choice of the characteristic wind-turbine farm used; and comparisons are provided with other similar studies. The study indicates that the overall technical potential is approximately 1100 TWh/y; and that about 70 GW of installed wind power could operate with capacity factors in excess of 24\%, resulting in an annual electricity generation of approximately 190 TWh/y, or 60\% of the electricity consumption in 2008.

The increasing diffusion of wind energy, however, has turned wind energy acceptance into a significant barrier with respect to the deployment of wind turbines. This article assesses whether, and at what cost, Austrian renewable energy targets can be met under different expansion scenarios considering the socio-political and market acceptance of wind energy. Land-use scenarios have been defined in a participatory modeling approach with stakeholders from various interest groups. We calculated the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for all of the potential wind turbine sites, which we used to generate wind energy supply curves. The results show that wind energy production could be expanded to 20\% of the final end energy demand in three out of four scenarios. However, more restrictive criteria increase LCOE by up to 20\%. In contrast to common views that see local opposition against wind projects as the main barrier for wind power expansion, our participatory modeling approach indicates that even on the level of key stakeholders, the future possible contribution of wind energy to Austrian renewable energy targets reaches from almost no further expansion to very high shares of wind energy.},

  abstract = {The wind energy being a freely available and low-carbon energy source has got the focus of decision makers around the world, because wind energy systems can reduce the dependence of a nation on fossil fuels and can contribute to a sustainable development of both climate and energy. However, wind power comes with certain environmental impacts and land use constraints that should be taken into account, in order to reach main sustainability goals concerning biodiversity and ecosystem services. The Swedish national goal regarding wind energy development has been set to 30~TWh by the year 2020, of which 20~TWh should come from the on-shore wind energy resource. Therefore, wind energy development in Sweden could play an important role in achieving the future energy and environmental targets. In this regard, we assessed the wind energy potential available in Sweden using a GIS-based approach. We aimed to estimate the technical onshore wind energy potential available in Sweden by considering system performance, topographic limitations, environmental, and land use constraints in the form of two restriction scenarios. The results of this paper can draw the attention of decision makers to reach a sustainable wind energy development in Sweden. The results achieved in this paper suggest that Sweden possesses sufficient wind energy potential and land area available for wind energy installations, which can be used to meet the future renewable energy targets in Sweden.},

  abstract = {Detailed information about the potential and costs of renewable energies is an important input for energy system models as well as for commercial and political decision-making processes. Especially wind energy with its increasing locally installed capacity and hub heights plays an important role when it comes to meeting climate targets and optimizing electricity networks. Recently however, wind energy has faced more and more social barriers and land use constraints which can negatively impact both political goals and investment decisions. Therefore this work presents a bottom-up methodology to estimate these effects by calculating the feasible potential and the associated costs for the German federal state of Baden-Württemberg as a case study. Landscape aesthetical aspects are considered and an algorithm applied based on graph-theoretical considerations to include spatial planning rules such as separation distances between wind farms. By means of spatially high-resolution land use data and techno-economic parameters, possible wind turbines are placed considering wind direction and variable spacing between turbines. In a further step, possible farm sites are located and assessed, and the result is presented in the form of cost-potential curves. The feasible potential is found to be between a third and a half of the technical potential and is between 11.8 and 29.1~TWh, with costs between 6.7 and 12.6~€ct/kWh. In addition, a substantial spatial shift in the location of future wind energy production can be observed when wind farm spacing is taken into account. The quality of the algorithm is tested against already existing wind farms and areas that are approved by regional authorities for the use of wind energy, and a very good correlation is observed. The focus in future work should lie on the development of an economic criterion that, unlike the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), is able to account for the system costs of a widespread wind energy development, including network expansion, balancing power and reserve energy costs. Further, visibility analysis could be implemented using digital elevation models to consider the topography for optimal wind farm spacing.},

The approximate required investment to meet national 2020 targets based on the National Renewable Energy Action Plans is estimated based on the model results. A comparison with the results of other studies shows significant deviations in the results, most of which can be explained through the differences in input parameters, and a comparison of the obtained results for Germany with those from a previous study under the same assumptions produced very similar results with a deviation of about 10\%.

Energy system models used for policy making typically have high technology detail but little spatial detail. However, the generation potential and integration costs of variable renewable energy sources and their time profile of production depend on geographic characteristics and infrastructure in place. For a case study for Austria we generate spatially highly resolved synthetic time series for potential production locations of wind power and PV. There are regional differences in the costs for wind turbines but not for PV. However, they are smaller than the cost reductions induced by technological learning from one modelled decade to the other. The wind availability shows significant regional differences where mainly the differences for summer days and winter nights are important. The solar availability for PV installations is more homogenous. We introduce these wind and PV data into the energy system model JRC-EU-TIMES with different levels of regional disaggregation. Results show that up to the point that the maximum potential is reached disaggregating wind regions significantly affects results causing lower electricity generation from wind and PV.},

  abstract = {Landscape ecology focuses on the spatial patterns and processes of ecological and human interactions. These patterns and processes are being altered by both changing resource-management practices of humans and changing climate conditions associated, in part, with increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Dominant resource-extraction and land-management activities involve energy, and the use of fossil energy is one of the key drivers behind increasing greenhouse gas emissions as well as land-use changes. Alternative energy sources (such as wind, solar, nuclear, and bioenergy) are being explored to reduce greenhouse gas emission rates. Yet, energy production, including alternative-energy options, can have a wide range of effects on land productivity, surface cover, albedo, and other factors that affect carbon, water, and energy fluxes and, in turn, climate. Meanwhile, climate influences the potential output, relative efficiencies, and sustainability of alternative energy sources. Thus, land use, climate change, and energy choices are linked, and any comprehensive analysis in landscape ecology that considers one of these factors should be cognizant of these interactions. This analysis explores the implications of linkages between land use, climate hange, and energy and points out ecological patterns and processes that may be affected by their interactions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The global technical potential of wind electricity is estimated to be 96 PWh year−1: about 6–7 times the present (2001) world electricity consumption at cut-off costs of about 1 US\$ kWh−1. To realise this potential, an area of 1.1 Gha is required when the wind turbines are installed at an average power density of 4 MW km−2. This is similar to the total global grassland area or to an area with the size of about China. The regionally highest technical potential of onshore wind energy is found for USA: 21 PWh year−1. Lowest figures are found for South East Asia, Southern and Western Africa and Japan. With present day technology, roughly an amount equal to the present (2001) world electricity consumption can be generated at a cost of 0.07 US\$ kWh−1 and below, mainly in Canada, USA, South America, OECD Europe and the former USSR.},

  abstract = {In this study, we develop an updated global estimate of onshore wind energy potential using reanalysis wind speed data, along with updated wind turbine technology performance, land suitability factors, cost assumptions, and explicit consideration of transmission distance in the calculation of transmission costs. We find that wind has the potential to supply a significant portion of the world energy needs, although this potential varies substantially by region and with assumptions such as on what types of land can be used to site wind farms. Total global economic wind potential under central assumptions, that is, intermediate between optimistic and pessimistic, is estimated to be approximately 119.5 petawatt hours per year (13.6 TW) at less than 9 cents/kWh. A sensitivity analysis of eight key parameters is presented. Wind potential is sensitive to a number of input parameters, particularly wind speed (varying by −70\% to +450\% at less than 9 cents/kWh), land suitability (by −55\% to +25\%), turbine density (by −60\% to +80\%), and cost and financing options (by −20\% to +200\%), many of which have important policy implications. As a result of sensitivities studied here we suggest that further research intended to inform wind supply curve development focus not purely on physical science, such as better resolved wind maps, but also on these less well-defined factors, such as land-suitability, that will also have an impact on the long-term role of wind power.},

  shorttitle = {Promoting Decentralized Sustainable Energy Systems in Different Supply Scenarios},
  abstract = {The development of decentralized renewable energy systems is of crucial importance for the decarbonization of energy generation worldwide. Purchase decisions regarding innovative energy systems depend to some extent on consumers' perception of the systems' degree of autarky. We assumed that, in addition to the energetic perspective, consumers associate other non-energetic facets such as independence, autonomy, self-sufficiency, or control with the concept of autarky. These psychological facets of autarky were expected to contribute to purchase decisions. In Study 1, participants (N = 168) evaluated three future energy supply scenarios. The scenarios varied regarding their range of autarky (household/neighborhood/small town), but the individually realized degree of energetic autarky did not vary. Participants reported a higher willingness to pay in connection with a higher perceived psychological autarky for the Household Scenario. Study 1's findings were confirmed by Study 2, in which qualitative interviews (N = 13) also revealed that participants favored the Household Scenario on several points. These evaluations were driven by the anticipated psychological facets of autarky that is the subjective perception of being independent, autonomous, self-sufficient, energy secure, and of control. To promote an adoption of renewable energy systems, these psychological autarky facets need to be addressed. Enabling the people to self-determine, control, and secure their energy provision even in complex organizational settings in such a manner is likely to increase their acceptance and therefore foster the required social transition as a whole. © 2017 Ecker, Hahnel and Spada.},

  abstract = {Currently, most PV (photovoltaic) modules are aligned in a way that maximizes annual yields. With an increasing number of PV installations, this leads to significant power peaks and could threaten energy policy objectives. Apparently sub-optimal inclinations and azimuth angles of PV plants on building roofs could counteract such tendencies by achieving significant temporal shifts in the electricity production. This paper addresses the potential of these counter-measures by evaluating the optimal regional mix of wind and PV installations with different mounting configurations in order to locally generate the annual electricity demand. It does so by adhering to three distinctive energy policy goals: economic efficiency, environmental sustainability and security of supply. The hourly yields of wind parks and nine PV orientations are simulated for four representative NUTS3-regions in Germany. These profiles are combined with regional electricity demand profiles and fed into an optimisation model. As a result, the optimal installed capacity for PV for every possible configuration - determined by inclination and azimuth angles - and the optimal installed capacity of wind power are obtained. The results indicate that the optimal mix differs significantly for each of the chosen goals, depending on regional conditions, but also shows a high transferability of general statements. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Whilst there are clear advantages to decentralized energy systems, one main disadvantage is their lack of economic scale effects. The development of decentralized energy systems goes hand in hand with a trend towards community energy. Many of these communities claim energy autonomy as their main motivation for investing in local renewable energies. They define energy autonomy as generation exceeding demand on an annual basis and are therefore less autonomous than without these technologies. Communities that strive for this ideal utilize the electricity network infrastructure more than traditional end of the pipe consumers. At the same time, they make a much lower contribution to the costs of this infrastructure, currently charged per unit of energy used, and often benefit from subsidized renewable energy technologies. Hence this motivation is at best questionable and at worst misplaced. A continuation of the recent rapid reductions in battery prices expected by many experts, however, could make the economic case for truly energy-autonomous municipalities. This clearly raises important questions for researchers and policymakers alike. For example, in which sorts of municipalities could such solutions make sense and what are the consequences for the overarching, mainly centralized energy system? © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {In the past, households in Germany widely invested in renewable energy technologies (mostly photovoltaic) to receive guaranteed return rates based on extensive subsidies. These feed-in tariffs have been tremendously reduced and, consequently, households’ behavioral motivations have changed: They have started to adopt various technologies to supply themselves with energy. In this study we investigate the underlying motivational factors that influence private households' intentions to purchase renewable energy system components with the purpose of partial energy self-supply. The study's data is comprised of qualitative interviews (N = 20) and a subsequent quantitative survey (N = 395) among homeowners of one-family houses and apartment houses from Germany. By studying their purchase intentions, we found perceived financial and autarky benefits are the most relevant attitudinal predictors, followed by environmental awareness and technology affinity. Besides attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control are important predictors of purchase intention. Policy makers and the industry could promote homeowners' purchasing behavior with tailored information strategies that address perceived autarky, financial benefits and subjective norms. We suggest support schemes for renewable energy systems to address perceived behavioral control factors. These schemes include necessary ongoing subsidies and a reliable regulatory and financial policy framework. This article contributes theoretically and practically to the environmental behavior and policy literature: It explains underlying behavioral factors such as autarky benefits and links them to policy recommendations such as supporting loans for energy-related investments by applying a behavior-policy framework. © 2018},

Energy democracy refers to political calls for and the institutionalisation of more participatory forms of energy provision and governance. The typology encompasses alternative approaches to energy provision and governance from the Global North and South, including instances of local autonomy in decentralised systems, urban struggles over public or cooperative ownership of energy utilities, and national approaches to energy sovereignty as alternatives to extractivist development. By drawing together this wide range of empirical examples, energy democracy could overcome both localist and euro-centric perspectives and provide an orientation for movements seeking to develop more just and sustainable energy systems around the world.},

Annual energy demands are compared for all 28 EU countries, while peak hourly demands are compared for four countries that vary significantly. The results indicate that the heat demand is currently the largest of the three demand types considered in terms of both annual and peak demands: it is the largest annual demand in 25 of the 28 EU countries, and it represents the largest peak demand in all four countries analysed. Electricity, heating, and cooling demands are all likely to change significantly in the future with increasing electrification, energy efficiency (e.g. building insulation), and improved comfort (especially for cooling). Some extreme scenarios are presented here to quantify the potential impact of these changes on the electricity sector, with results revealing that the demand for electricity could double compared to today, depending on how these changes occur. Considering the scale of additional electricity required to electrify future heating and cooling demands, heat pumps should be prioritised over electric heating and other alternatives, such as district heating and cooling, will likely be required to minimise the strain on the electricity grid in the future.},

In this paper both cross-sector and cross-border integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporally-resolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.},

More than 50 papers are studied to identify the site suitability methodologies, decision criteria, and restriction factors, use of Multicriteria decision-making techniques, Geographical information system (GIS), and dealing with uncertainty in installing utility-size solar PV. The results of our study show that analytical hierarchy process and its extensions are the most common methodology, followed by overlay tool analysis in GIS environment. Solar PV site suitability studies considered solar irradiation amount as the most important criteria followed by the proximity to power lines and land slope, whereas the protected lands and watercourses considered the highest restriction factors described in the literature that should be taken into account when facilitating site selection for utility-scale solar PV projects. More than 80\% of studies are addressing grid-connected solar PV where China leads the site suitability studies followed by Spain and India. As per authors' knowledge, this is an original contribution to review site suitability methodologies, decision criteria, and restriction factors for the solar PV.},

Increased activity within model development in recent years has led to several new models and modelling capabilities, partly motivated by the need to better represent the integration of variable renewables. The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.},

The power density of low-carbon energy sources will play an important role in mediating the environmental consequences of energy system decarbonization as the world transitions away from high power-density fossil fuels. All else equal, lower power densities mean larger land and environmental footprints. The power density of solar and wind power remain surprisingly uncertain: estimates of realizable generation rates per unit area for wind and solar power span 0.3–47 W e m −2 and 10–120 W e m −2 respectively. We refine this range using US data from 1990–2016. We estimate wind power density from primary data, and solar power density from primary plant-level data and prior datasets on capacity density. The mean power density of 411 onshore wind power plants in 2016 was 0.50 W e m −2 . Wind plants with the largest areas have the lowest power densities. Wind power capacity factors are increasing, but that increase is associated with a decrease in capacity densities, so power densities are stable or declining. If wind power expands away from the best locations and the areas of wind power plants keep increasing, it seems likely that wind’s power density will decrease as total wind generation increases. The mean 2016 power density of 1150 solar power plants was 5.4 W e m −2 . Solar capacity factors and (likely) power densities are increasing with time driven, in part, by improved panel efficiencies. Wind power has a 10-fold lower power density than solar, but wind power installations directly occupy much less of the land within their boundaries. The environmental and social consequences of these divergent land occupancy patterns need further study.},

Here we explore how models have consistently underestimated PV deployment and identify the reasons for underlying bias in models. Our analysis reveals that rapid technological learning and technology-specific policy support were crucial to PV deployment in the past, but that future success will depend on adequate financing instruments and the management of system integration. We propose that with coordinated advances in multiple components of the energy system, PV could supply 30–50\% of electricity in competitive markets.},

  abstract = {A transition towards a 100\% renewable energy (RE) power sector by 2050 is investigated for Europe. Simulations using an hourly resolved model define the roles of storage technologies in a least cost system configuration. The investigated technologies are batteries, pumped hydro storage, adiabatic compressed air energy storage, thermal energy storage, and power-to-gas technology. Modelling proceeds from 2015 to 2050 in five-year time steps, and considers current power plant capacities, their corresponding lifetimes, and current and projected electricity demand to determine an optimal mix of plants needed to achieve a 100\% RE power system by 2050. This optimization is carried out with regards to the assumed costs and technological status of all technologies involved. The total power capacity required by 2050, shares of resources, and storage technologies are defined. Results indicate that the levelised cost of electricity falls from a current level of 69 €/MWhe to 51 €/MWhe in 2050 through the adoption of low cost RE power generation, improvements in efficiency, and expanded power interconnections. Additionally, flexibility of and stability in the power system are provided by increasing shares of energy storage solutions over time, in parallel with expected price decreases in these technologies. Total storage requirements include up to 3320 GWhe of batteries, 396 GWhe of pumped hydro storage, and 218,042 GWhgas of gas storage (8\% for synthetic natural gas and 92\% for biomethane) for the time period depending on the scenario. The cost share of levelised cost of storage in the total levelised cost of electricity increases from less than 2 €/MWh (2\% of total) to 16 €/MWh (28\% of total) over the same time. Outputs of power-to-gas begin in 2020 when renewable energy generation reaches 50\% in the power system, increasing to a total of 44 TWhgas in 2050. A 100\% RE system can be a more economical and efficient solution for Europe, one that is also compatible with climate change mitigation targets set out in the Paris Agreement.},

Nonetheless, a growing body of evidence suggests these technologies form an attractive option for the deep decarbonisation of global energy systems, and that recent improvements in their cost and performance point towards economic viability as well. This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential role that hydrogen could play in the provision of electricity, heat, industry, transport and energy storage in a low-carbon energy system, and an assessment of the status of hydrogen in being able to fulfil that potential. The picture that emerges is one of qualified promise: hydrogen is well established in certain niches such as forklift trucks, while mainstream applications are now forthcoming. Hydrogen vehicles are available commercially in several countries, and 225 000 fuel cell home heating systems have been sold. This represents a step change from the situation of only five years ago. This review shows that challenges around cost and performance remain, and considerable improvements are still required for hydrogen to become truly competitive. But such competitiveness in the medium-term future no longer seems an unrealistic prospect, which fully justifies the growing interest and policy support for these technologies around the world.},

  abstract = {In a first part, this work examines the potential of Swiss storage hydropower due to dam heightening. For each dam, the feasibility of dam heightening by 5\%, 10\% and 20\% of the existing dam height is investigated. Based on the reviews of the dam heightening options, the additional storage capacity is estimated for several scenarios. With dam heightening at 23 reservoirs, the additional storage capacity is 1058 Mio m3 and the additional winter energy production amounts 3.4 TWh. Another scenario takes into account dam heightening by 20\% of the existing dam height at 30 reservoirs. The additional storage capacity amounts 1530 Mio m3 and the winter energy production can be increased by 4.8 TWh. Due to the Energy Strategy 2050, in the year 2050 the needed additional winter energy production amounts between 3 and 7.7 TWh (Piot, 2014). Dam heightening has the potential to provide a considerably part of the needed additional winter energy production. In the second part of the thesis, dam heightening at the Gries gravity dam is considered in more detail. Dam heightening alternatives, by 5\%, 10\% and 20\% of the existing dam height, are investigated. Since the inflows are not sufficient to fill the extended reservoir each year, different locations for a compensation basin are examined. From an energy-policy point of view aiming at increasing the Swiss electricity production from hydropower in winter, the alternative with the highest additional storage capacity is selected for a more detailed study. Within the development of the preliminary project, the stability of the dam, the spillway, the waterway and the compensation basin are examined in more detail. The project costs are estimated at 48 million francs. Currently dam heightening at the Griessee is not economical but would be interesting if the market situation would change.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}The future role of stationary electricity storage is perceived as highly uncertain. One reason is that most studies into the future cost of storage technologies focus on investment cost. An appropriate cost assessment must be based on the application-specific lifetime cost of storing electricity. We determine the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for 9 technologies in 12 power system applications from 2015 to 2050 based on projected investment cost reductions and current performance parameters. We find that LCOS will reduce by one-third to one-half by 2030 and 2050, respectively, across the modeled applications, with lithium ion likely to become most cost efficient for nearly all stationary applications from 2030. Investments in alternative technologies may prove futile unless significant performance improvements can retain competitiveness with lithium ion. These insights increase transparency around the future competitiveness of electricity storage technologies and can help guide research, policy, and investment activities to ensure cost-efficient deployment.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Energy policy and investment are commonly informed by a small number of scenarios, modelled with proprietary models and closed data-sets. It limits what levels of insight that can be derived from it. This paper overcomes these critical concerns by exploring a large number of scenarios with an open-data and open-source model to address regional mitigation policy. Focusing on South America, we translate an ensemble of long-term electricity supply scenarios into policy insights and use post-processing methods to present a systematic mapping of solution outputs to model inputs. We find demand levels, the cost of capital and the level of CO2-limits to be significant determinants of total investment cost. Low-carbon pathways are associated with low demand and low cost of capital. When cost of capital increases a shift away from wind and hydropower to natural gas and solar PV is seen. We further show that appropriate concessionary finance together with energy efficiency measures are critical – at a continental level – to unlock economic, low-carbon investment.},

  abstract = {One solution to the large-scale integration of renewable energies could be decentralised autonomous municipal energy systems. Several studies have already analysed the technical and economic implications of the mainly decentralised future energy system, but most are restricted in their insights by limited temporal and spatial resolution. This study employs a cluster analysis to develop a municipality typology in order to analyse the techno-economic suitability of municipalities for autonomous energy systems. A total of 34 socio-technical indicators are employed at the municipal level, with a particular focus on the sectors of Private Households and Transport, and the potentials for decentralised renewable energies. Selected quantitative cluster validation methods are employed alongside qualitative criteria to determine the optimal number of clusters. This results in a total of ten clusters, which show a large variation as well as some overlap with respect to specific indicators. An analysis of the municipalities from three German renewable energy projects “Energy Municipalities”, “Bioenergy Villages” and “100\% Renewable Energy Regions” shows that in eight of the ten clusters municipalities are aiming for energy autonomy (in varying degrees). It is challenging to differentiate between the clusters regarding readiness for energy autonomy projects, however, especially if the degree of social acceptance and engagement for such projects is to be considered. To answer the more techno-economical part of this question, future work will employ the developed clusters in the context of an energy system optimisation. Insights gained at the municipal level will then be qualitatively transferred to the national context to assess the implications for the whole energy system.},

This data can be utilized to enhance energy systems modeling in terms of heterogeneity, confidence, and transparency. Furthermore, it allows to shift away from the common practice of considering average values towards probability distributions. In turn, heterogeneity and randomness of the real-world can be captured that are usually found in large samples of real-world data. This paper presents a methodological framework for an empirical deterministic\&ndash;stochastic modeling approach to utilize large real-world datasets in long-term energy systems modeling. A new software system\&mdash;OSeMOSYS-PuLP\&mdash;was developed and is available now.It adds the feature of Monte Carlo simulations to the existing open-source energy modeling system (the OSeMOSYS modeling framework). An application example is given, in which the initial application example of OSeMOSYS is used and modified to include real-world operation data from a public bus transport system.},

But what effect does communication of such epistemic uncertainty have? Empirical research is widely scattered across many disciplines. This interdisciplinary review structures and summarizes current practice and research across domains, combining a statistical and psychological perspective. This informs a framework for uncertainty communication in which we identify three objects of uncertainty—facts, numbers and science—and two levels of uncertainty: direct and indirect. An examination of current practices provides a scale of nine expressions of direct uncertainty. We discuss attempts to codify indirect uncertainty in terms of quality of the underlying evidence. We review the limited literature about the effects of communicating epistemic uncertainty on cognition, affect, trust and decision-making. While there is some evidence that communicating epistemic uncertainty does not necessarily affect audiences negatively, impact can vary between individuals and communication formats. Case studies in economic statistics and climate change illustrate our framework in action. We conclude with advice to guide both communicators and future researchers in this important but so far rather neglected field.},

  abstract = {Deep decarbonization of the electricity sector can be provided by a high penetration of renewable sources such as wind, solar PV and hydro power. Flexibility from hydro and storage complements the high temporal variability of wind and solar, and transmission infrastructure helps the power balancing by moving electricity in the spatial dimension. We study cost-optimal highly-renewable Chinese power systems under ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets, by deploying a 31-node hourly-resolved techno-economic optimization model supported by a validated weather-converted 38-year-long renewable power generation and electricity demand dataset. With a new realistic reservoir hydro model, we find that if CO2 emission reduction goes beyond 70\%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary for a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility components can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV share by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We show that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional inter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than ultra-high-voltage-AC-connected “One-Net” grid. Finally, constraining transmission volume from the optimum by up to 25\% does not push total costs much higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with abundant interconnectivity.},
