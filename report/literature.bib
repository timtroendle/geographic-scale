  abstract = {Site selection for the utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) solar farm is a critical issue due to its direct impact on the power performance, economic, environmental, social aspects, and existing as well as future infrastructures. In this chapter, we conduct a literature review on site selection of solar PV power plants. More than 50 papers are studied to identify the site suitability methodologies, decision criteria, and restriction factors, use of Multicriteria decision-making techniques, Geographical information system (GIS), and dealing with uncertainty in installing utility-size solar PV. The results of our study show that analytical hierarchy process and its extensions are the most common methodology, followed by overlay tool analysis in GIS environment. Solar PV site suitability studies considered solar irradiation amount as the most important criteria followed by the proximity to power lines and land slope, whereas the protected lands and watercourses considered the highest restriction factors described in the literature that should be taken into account when facilitating site selection for utility-scale solar PV projects. More than 80\% of studies are addressing grid-connected solar PV where China leads the site suitability studies followed by Spain and India. As per authors' knowledge, this is an original contribution to review site suitability methodologies, decision criteria, and restriction factors for the solar PV.},

  abstract = {We present a new high-resolution global renewable energy atlas (REatlas) that can be used to calculate customised hourly time series of wind and solar PV power generation. In this paper, the atlas is applied to produce 32-year-long hourly model wind power time series for Denmark for each historical and future year between 1980 and 2035. These are calibrated and validated against real production data from the period 2000 to 2010. The high number of years allows us to discuss how the characteristics of Danish wind power generation varies between individual weather years. As an example, the annual energy production is found to vary by ±10\% from the average. Furthermore, we show how the production pattern change as small onshore turbines are gradually replaced by large onshore and offshore turbines. Finally, we compare our wind power time series for 2020 to corresponding data from a handful of Danish energy system models. The aim is to illustrate how current differences in model wind may result in significant differences in technical and economical model predictions. These include up to 15\% differences in installed capacity and 40\% differences in system reserve requirements.}

We argue that by combining these, in fact, complementary measures, it is possible to address the crucial issue of renewable generation—fluctuating supply—in a comprehensive as well as in a technologically and economically viable manner. Thus, the SuperSmart Grid simultaneously can contribute to energy security, climate security, social security, and national security.},

  abstract = {The use of coal for electricity generation is the main emitter of Greenhous Gas Emissions worldwide. According to the International Energy Agency, these emissions have to be reduced by more than 70\% by 2040 to stay on track for the 1.5–2 ◦C scenario suggested by the Paris Agreement. To ensure a socially fair transition towards the phase-out of coal, the European Commission introduced the Coal Regions in Transition initiative in late 2017. The present paper analyses to what extent the use of photovoltaic electricity generation systems can help with this transition in the coal regions of the European Union (EU). A spatially explicit methodology was developed to assess the solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in selected regions where open-cast coal mines are planned to cease operation in the near future. Different types of solar PV systems were considered including ground-mounted systems developed either on mining land or its surroundings. Furthermore, the installation of rooftop solar PV systems on the existing building stock was also analysed. The obtained results show that the available area in those regions is abundant and that solar PV systems could fully substitute the current electricity generation of coal-fired power plants in the analysed regions.},

Here we analyse the authors' methodology and find it problematic. The feasibility criteria chosen by the authors are important, but are also easily addressed at low cost, while not affecting the main conclusions of the reviewed studies and certainly not affecting their technical feasibility. A more thorough review reveals that all of the issues have already been addressed in the engineering and modelling literature. Nuclear power, as advocated by some of the authors, faces other, genuine feasibility problems, such as the finiteness of uranium resources and a reliance on unproven technologies in the medium- to long-term. Energy systems based on renewables, on the other hand, are not only feasible, but already economically viable and getting cheaper every day.},

  abstract = {There are two competing concepts in the literature for the integration of high shares of renewable energy: the coupling of electricity to other energy sectors, such as transport and heating, and the reinforcement of continent-wide transmission networks. In this paper both cross-sector and cross-border integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporally-resolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.}

With the RE generators at the location of high harvest potential, the appropriate dimension of storage and transmission system between different regions, a cost efficient system can be achieved. To find the preferred target system, the optimization tool GENESYS (Genetic Optimization of a European Energy System) was developed. The example calculations under the assumption of 100\% self-supply, show a need of about 2,500 GW RES in total, a storage capacity of about 240,000 GWh, corresponding to 6\% of the annual energy demand, and a HVDC transmission grid of 375,000 GWkm.

  abstract = {A transition towards a 100\% renewable energy (RE) power sector by 2050 is investigated for Europe. Simulations using an hourly resolved model define the roles of storage technologies in a least cost system configuration. The investigated technologies are batteries, pumped hydro storage, adiabatic compressed air energy storage, thermal energy storage, and power-to-gas technology. Modelling proceeds from 2015 to 2050 in five-year time steps, and considers current power plant capacities, their corresponding lifetimes, and current and projected electricity demand to determine an optimal mix of plants needed to achieve a 100\% RE power system by 2050. This optimization is carried out with regards to the assumed costs and technological status of all technologies involved. The total power capacity required by 2050, shares of resources, and storage technologies are defined. Results indicate that the levelised cost of electricity falls from a current level of 69 €/MWhe to 51 €/MWhe in 2050 through the adoption of low cost RE power generation, improvements in efficiency, and expanded power interconnections. Additionally, flexibility of and stability in the power system are provided by increasing shares of energy storage solutions over time, in parallel with expected price decreases in these technologies. Total storage requirements include up to 3320 GWhe of batteries, 396 GWhe of pumped hydro storage, and 218,042 GWhgas of gas storage (8\% for synthetic natural gas and 92\% for biomethane) for the time period depending on the scenario. The cost share of levelised cost of storage in the total levelised cost of electricity increases from less than 2 €/MWh (2\% of total) to 16 €/MWh (28\% of total) over the same time. Outputs of power-to-gas begin in 2020 when renewable energy generation reaches 50\% in the power system, increasing to a total of 44 TWhgas in 2050. A 100\% RE system can be a more economical and efficient solution for Europe, one that is also compatible with climate change mitigation targets set out in the Paris Agreement.},

  abstract = {This study presents one scenario for a 100\% renewable energy system in Europe by the year 2050. The transition from a business-as-usual situation in 2050, to a 100\% renewable energy Europe is analysed in a series of steps. Each step reflects one major technological change. For each step, the impact is presented in terms of energy (primary energy supply), environment (carbon dioxide emissions), and economy (total annual socio-economic cost). The steps are ordered in terms of their scientific and political certainty as follows: decommissioning nuclear power, implementing a large amount of heat savings, converting the private car fleet to electricity, providing heat in rural areas with heat pumps, providing heat in urban areas with district heating, converting fuel in heavy-duty vehicles to a renewable electrofuel, and replacing natural gas with methane. The results indicate that by using the Smart Energy System approach, a 100\% renewable energy system in Europe is technically possible without consuming an unsustainable amount of bioenergy. This is due to the additional flexibility that is created by connecting the electricity, heating, cooling, and transport sectors together, which enables an intermittent renewable penetration of over 80\% in the electricity sector. The cost of the Smart Energy Europe scenario is approximately 10–15\% higher than a business-as-usual scenario, but since the final scenario is based on local investments instead of imported fuels, it will create approximately 10 million additional direct jobs within the EU.}

  abstract = {Abstract ERA-Interim is the latest global atmospheric reanalysis produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The ERA-Interim project was conducted in part to prepare for a new atmospheric reanalysis to replace ERA-40, which will extend back to the early part of the twentieth century. This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF. Copyright ? 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {Pumped hydro energy storage (PHS) currently is the only electricity grid storage technology with substantial deployment throughout the world, representing over 99\% of storage capacity, but other storage technologies such as batteries are increasingly finding application. In Europe, the implementation of storage systems is expected to increase because of the integration of intermittent, nondispatchable renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, there is no overview available of the power and energy ratings of large-scale stationary storage at the supranational level. In the absence of officially collected statistics on energy capacity, publicly available information is collected from storage owners, freely accessible databases, scientific articles, reports, brochures and government websites. The status of PHS and other large-scale storage technologies in the EU-28 countries, supplemented by Norway and Switzerland, is presented. First, this paper defines a measure of energy storage capacity, to allow comparison of pumped hydro storage plants with other storage technologies. Next, a set of technical parameters of current large-scale storage plants is presented, as well as an overview of planned storage projects. The estimate of PHS power ratings in the EU-28 exceeds previous estimates, with a total of 160 plants and 45.283GW rated power in turbine mode and a full cycle storage capacity of 602GWh. When adding Norway and Switzerland, a total of 188 operational PHS plants is shown with 1313GWh. The data is used to obtain EU-wide discharge curves and national indicators of utilization and significance.},

  abstract = {Variable renewable energy (VRE) resources increasingly add fluctuations to power systems. The required types and capacities of balancing measures, amounts of curtailment, and costs associated with system integration need to be assessed for advising policy makers and economic actors. Previous studies mostly exclude storage from model-endogenous capacity expansion and omit concentrated solar power (CSP) completely. In this study, we stress the need for grid and backup capacity by investigating an integrated market in Europe, allowing for additional short-term as well as long-term storage and considering CSP as a dispatchable backup option. The Renewable Energy Mix (REMix) energy system model is introduced and applied to assess the capacity expansion and hourly dispatch at various levels of photovoltaic and wind power penetration. The model results demonstrate combinations of spatial and temporal balancing measures that enable net photovoltaic and wind supply shares of 60\% and 70\% of the annual demand, respectively. The usage of storage and grid can keep curtailments below 20\% of the demand for theoretical VRE shares of up to 100\%. Furthermore, we determine that the VRE supply structure has a strong impact on the least-cost allocation of power plants across Europe but only a limited effect on supply costs.}

  abstract = {As wind and solar power provide a growing share of Europe’s electricity1, understanding and accommodating their variability on multiple timescales remains a critical problem. On weekly timescales, variability is related to long-lasting weather conditions, called weather regimes2,3,4,5, which can cause lulls with a loss of wind power across neighbouring countries6. Here we show that weather regimes provide a meteorological explanation for multi-day fluctuations in Europe’s wind power and can help guide new deployment pathways that minimize this variability. Mean generation during different regimes currently ranges from 22 GW to 44 GW and is expected to triple by 2030 with current planning strategies. However, balancing future wind capacity across regions with contrasting inter-regime behaviour—specifically deploying in the Balkans instead of the North Sea—would almost eliminate these output variations, maintain mean generation, and increase fleet-wide minimum output. Solar photovoltaics could balance low-wind regimes locally, but only by expanding current capacity tenfold. New deployment strategies based on an understanding of continent-scale wind patterns and pan-European collaboration could enable a high share of wind energy whilst minimizing the negative impacts of output variability.},

  abstract = {This study provides estimates of photovoltaic (PV) panel optimal tilt angles for all countries worldwide. It then estimates the incident solar radiation normal to either tracked or optimally tilted panels relative to horizontal panels globally. Optimal tilts are derived from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s PVWatts program. A simple 3rd-order polynomial fit of optimal tilt versus latitude is derived. The fit matches data better above 40° N latitude than do previous linear fits. Optimal tilts are then used in the global 3-D GATOR-GCMOM model to estimate annual ratios of incident radiation normal to optimally tilted, 1-axis vertically tracked (swiveling vertically around a horizontal axis), 1-axis horizontally tracked (at optimal tilt and swiveling horizontally around a vertical axis), and 2-axis tracked panels relative to horizontal panels in 2050. Globally- and annually-averaged, these ratios are ∼1.19, ∼1.22, ∼1.35, and ∼1.39, respectively. 1-axis horizontal tracking differs from 2-axis tracking, annually averaged, by only 1–3\% at most all latitudes. 1-axis horizontal tracking provides much more output than 1-axis vertical tracking below 65° N and S, whereas output is similar elsewhere. Tracking provides little benefit over optimal tilting above 75° N and 60° S. Tilting and tracking benefits generally increase with increasing latitude. In fact, annually averaged, more sunlight reach tilted or tracked panels from 80 to 90° S than any other latitude. Tilting and tracking benefit cities of the same latitude with lesser aerosol and cloud cover. In sum, for optimal utility PV output, 1-axis horizontal tracking is recommended, except for the highest latitudes, where optimal tilting is sufficient. However, decisions about panel configuration also require knowing tracking equipment and land costs, which are not evaluated here. Installers should also calculate optimal tilt angles for their location for more accuracy. Models that ignore optimal tilting for rooftop PV and utility PV tracking may underestimate significantly country or world PV potential.}

  abstract = {Despite significant recent advancements, global hydrological models and their input databases still show limited capabilities in supporting many spatially detailed research questions and integrated assessments, such as required in freshwater ecology or applied water resources management. In order to address these challenges, the scientific community needs to create improved large-scale datasets and more flexible data structures that enable the integration of information across and within spatial scales; develop new and advanced models that support the assessment of longitudinal and lateral hydrological connectivity; and provide an accessible modeling environment for researchers, decision makers, and practitioners. As a contribution, we here present a new modeling framework that integrates hydrographic baseline data at a global scale (enhanced HydroSHEDS layers and coupled datasets) with new modeling tools, specifically a river network routing model (HydroROUT) that is currently under development. The resulting ‘hydro-spatial fabric’ is designed to provide an avenue for advanced hydro-ecological applications at large scales in a consistent and highly versatile way. Preliminary results from case studies to assess human impacts on water quality and the effects of dams on river fragmentation and downstream flow regulation illustrate the potential of this combined data-and-modeling framework to conduct novel research in the fields of aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, geo-statistical modeling, or pollution and health risk assessments. The global scale outcomes are at a previously unachieved spatial resolution of 500 m and can thus support local planning and decision making in many of the world's large river basins.

  abstract = {In a first part, this work examines the potential of Swiss storage hydropower due to dam heightening. For each dam, the feasibility of dam heightening by 5\%, 10\% and 20\% of the existing dam height is investigated. Based on the reviews of the dam heightening options, the additional storage capacity is estimated for several scenarios. With dam heightening at 23 reservoirs, the additional storage capacity is 1058 Mio m3 and the additional winter energy production amounts 3.4 TWh. Another scenario takes into account dam heightening by 20\% of the existing dam height at 30 reservoirs. The additional storage capacity amounts 1530 Mio m3 and the winter energy production can be increased by 4.8 TWh. Due to the Energy Strategy 2050, in the year 2050 the needed additional winter energy production amounts between 3 and 7.7 TWh (Piot, 2014). Dam heightening has the potential to provide a considerably part of the needed additional winter energy production. In the second part of the thesis, dam heightening at the Gries gravity dam is considered in more detail. Dam heightening alternatives, by 5\%, 10\% and 20\% of the existing dam height, are investigated. Since the inflows are not sufficient to fill the extended reservoir each year, different locations for a compensation basin are examined. From an energy-policy point of view aiming at increasing the Swiss electricity production from hydropower in winter, the alternative with the highest additional storage capacity is selected for a more detailed study. Within the development of the preliminary project, the stability of the dam, the spillway, the waterway and the compensation basin are examined in more detail. The project costs are estimated at 48 million francs. Currently dam heightening at the Griessee is not economical but would be interesting if the market situation would change.},

  abstract = {Deep decarbonization of the electricity sector can be provided by a high penetration of renewable sources such as wind, solar PV and hydro power. Flexibility from hydro and storage complements the high temporal variability of wind and solar, and transmission infrastructure helps the power balancing by moving electricity in the spatial dimension. We study cost-optimal highly-renewable Chinese power systems under ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets, by deploying a 31-node hourly-resolved techno-economic optimization model supported by a validated weather-converted 38-year-long renewable power generation and electricity demand dataset. With a new realistic reservoir hydro model, we find that if CO2 emission reduction goes beyond 70\%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary for a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility components can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV share by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We show that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional inter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than ultra-high-voltage-AC-connected “One-Net” grid. Finally, constraining transmission volume from the optimum by up to 25\% does not push total costs much higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with abundant interconnectivity.}

  abstract = {Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented.},

For the EU28 and Europe technical potentials of 15~PWh/a and 20~PWh/a are determined respectively, with associated LCOEs (Levelized Costs of Electricity) of between 6 and 50 €ct/kWh and large variations between countries: the largest potentials and lowest generation costs are to be found in the UK, Poland and Sweden. The approximate required investment to meet national 2020 targets based on the National Renewable Energy Action Plans is estimated based on the model results. A comparison with the results of other studies shows significant deviations in the results, most of which can be explained through the differences in input parameters, and a comparison of the obtained results for Germany with those from a previous study under the same assumptions produced very similar results with a deviation of about 10\%. A sensitivity analysis showed that the results are only moderately sensitive to the assumed discount rate as well as the size of turbines available.}

  abstract = {The adoption of solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies has expanded rapidly in recent years, leading to suggestions that this growth, which occurred mostly in high-latitude countries with often low levels of sunshine, may have come at an unnecessarily high price. However, the factors influencing the cost of solar PV, and the subsidies required to sustain its uptake, include more than just the level of sunshine. While cross-country differences in technology costs are hard to ascertain, it is possible to account for the cost of capital on a country-by-country basis. In this paper, we therefore map the cost of solar PV globally, accounting for differences in both the solar resource and the financing cost in order to calculate the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from solar PV systems in 143 countries. In contrast to the work of other researchers who typically treat financing costs as uniform across countries, our results suggest that the LCOE of solar PV systems in northern countries may in fact be lower than in equatorial countries, and high latitude countries may thus not have been an unwise location to subsidize the adoption of solar PV technologies in the past. Our results further suggest that efforts to expand PV installation in equatorial developing countries may benefit greatly from policies designed to make low cost finance more widely available, which underlines on-going efforts to “de-risk” low carbon investments.},

  abstract = {Using a high-resolution planning model of the Great Britain power system and 25years of simulated wind and PV generation data, this study compares different methods to reduce time resolution of energy models to increase their computational tractability: downsampling, clustering, and heuristics. By comparing model results in terms of costs and installed capacities across different methods, this study shows that the best method depends heavily on input data and the setup of model constraints. This implies that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the problem of time step reduction, but heuristic approaches appear promising. In addition, the 25years of time series demonstrate considerable inter-year variability in wind and PV power output. This further complicates the problem of time detail in energy models as it suggests long time series are necessary. Model results with high shares of PV and wind generation using a single or few years of data are likely unreliable. Better modeling and planning methods are required to determine robust scenarios with high shares of variable renewables. The methods are implemented in the freely available open-source modeling framework Calliope.},

  abstract = {Globally, due to industrialization, GHG emissions continue to increase. This is despite the existing scientific and political consensus to fight human-induced climate change. To reverse this trend, viable, cost-effective decarbonization pathways are needed. We focus on the European power supply system and demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility of reaching the EU's mitigation targets by 2050. We show that a transition from conventional to renewable-based power supply systems is possible for the EU even with a politically driven nuclear power phase-out. We provide a guideline for European stakeholders that shows how to transform their power generation systems. By following our recommendations, the EU can be a role model for other countries and regions moving towards decarbonization. Our work is guided by two main motivations: • How can the transition of Europe's power system be modeled adequately? • What is the techno-economically optimal transition pathway for meeting the EU GHG power sector emission targets by 2050? A comparison of power system models has revealed a need for a combined short and long-term simulation tool that includes the principal power generation, storage and transmission technologies being considered in Europe. We adapted and applied the linear model elesplan-m to simulate a techno-economically optimized decarbonization pathway for 18 interconnected European regions and found that meeting the EU's reduction targets, i.e. reducing the GHG emissions from 1300 to 24~Mt CO2eq per year by 2050, can be achieved by large-scale capacity investment in renewable energy sources (RES). The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) would increase from 6.7 to 9.0 ctEUR/kWh and investments of 403 billion EUR would be necessary during the 34 year period analyzed. In 2050, the resulting power supply system is largely composed of wind power (1485~GW) and PV (909~GW), which are supported by 150~GW hydro power and 244~GW gas power. In addition, 432~GW of storage and 362~GW of transmission capacity are required to temporally and spatially distribute electricity. This work provides not only a feasible concept for a decarbonized power supply system, but shows also the implementation steps necessary to make the transition to that system cost-effective.}

By applying a dispatch strategy that minimizes the balancing energy needs for a given storage size, the interplay between storage and balancing is quantified, providing a hard upper limit on their synergy. An efficient but relatively small storage reduces balancing energy needs significantly due to its influence on intra-day mismatches. Furthermore, we show that combined with a low-efficiency hydrogen storage and a level of balancing equal to what is today provided by storage lakes, it is sufficient to meet the European electricity demand in a fully renewable power system where the average power generation from combined wind and solar exceeds the demand by only a few percent.},

Estimates are based on extensive weather data, which allows for modelling of hourly mismatches between the demand and renewable generation from wind and solar photovoltaics. For separated countries, balancing is required to cover around 24\% of the total annual electricity consumption. This number can be reduced down to 15\% once all countries are networked together with unconstrained interconnectors. The reduction represents the maximum possible benefit of transmission for the countries. The total Net Transfer Capacity of the unconstrained interconnectors is roughly 11.5 times larger than current values. However, constrained interconnector capacities 5.7 times larger than the current values are found to provide 98\% of the maximum possible benefit of transmission. This motivates a detailed investigation of several constrained transmission capacity layouts to determine the export and import capabilities of countries participating in a fully renewable European electricity system.},

  abstract = {To reach ambitious European CO2 emission reduction targets, most scenarios of future European electricity systems rely on large shares of wind and solar photovoltaic power generation. We interpolate between two concepts for balancing the variability of these renewable sources: balancing at continental scales using the transmission grid and balancing locally with storage. This interpolation is done by systematically restricting transmission capacities from the optimum level to zero. We run techno-economic cost optimizations for the capacity investment and dispatch of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural gas power generation and transmission, as well as storage options such as pumped-hydro, battery, and hydrogen storage. The simulations assume a 95\% CO2 emission reduction compared to 1990, and are run over a full historical year of weather and electricity demand for 30 European countries. In the cost-optimal system with high levels of transmission expansion, energy generation is dominated by wind (65\%) and hydro (15\%), with average system costs comparable to today's system. Restricting transmission shifts the balance in favour of solar and storage, driving up costs by a third. As the restriction is relaxed, 85\% of the cost benefits of the optimal grid expansion can be captured already with only 44\% of the transmission volume.}

We determine the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for 9 technologies in 12 power system applications from 2015 to 2050 based on projected investment cost reductions and current performance parameters. We find that LCOS will reduce by one-third to one-half by 2030 and 2050, respectively, across the modeled applications, with lithium ion likely to become most cost efficient for nearly all stationary applications from 2030. Investments in alternative technologies may prove futile unless significant performance improvements can retain competitiveness with lithium ion.

However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly proven. This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing NASA's MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50\% in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30\% in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2\%, with countries ranging from 19.5\% (Germany) to 32.4\% (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23\% more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3\%. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4\% and Germany's to 29.1\%.},

  abstract = {Global sensitivity analysis (SA) aims at quantifying the respective effects of input random variables (or combinations thereof) onto the variance of the response of a physical or mathematical model. Among the abundant literature on sensitivity measures, the Sobol’ indices have received much attention since they provide accurate information for most models. The paper introduces generalized polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) to build surrogate models that allow one to compute the Sobol’ indices analytically as a post-processing of the PCE coefficients. Thus the computational cost of the sensitivity indices practically reduces to that of estimating the PCE coefficients. An original non intrusive regression-based approach is proposed, together with an experimental design of minimal size. Various application examples illustrate the approach, both from the field of global SA (i.e. well-known benchmark problems) and from the field of stochastic mechanics. The proposed method gives accurate results for various examples that involve up to eight input random variables, at a computational cost which is 2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than the traditional Monte Carlo-based evaluation of the Sobol’ indices.},

  abstract = {In this study, we model seven scenarios for the European power system in 2050 based on 100\% renewable energy sources, assuming different levels of future demand and technology availability, and compare them with a scenario which includes low-carbon non-renewable technologies. We find that a 100\% renewable European power system could operate with the same level of system adequacy as today when relying on European resources alone, even in the most challenging weather year observed in the period from 1979 to 2015. However, based on our scenario results, realising such a system by 2050 would require: (i) a 90\% increase in generation capacity to at least 1.9 TW (compared with 1 TW installed today), (ii) reliable cross-border transmission capacity at least 140 GW higher than current levels (60 GW), (iii) the well-managed integration of heat pumps and electric vehicles into the power system to reduce demand peaks and biogas requirements, (iv) the implementation of energy efficiency measures to avoid even larger increases in required biomass demand, generation and transmission capacity, (v) wind deployment levels of 7.5 GW y−1 (currently 10.6 GW y−1) to be maintained, while solar photovoltaic deployment to increase to at least 15 GW y−1 (currently 10.5 GW y−1), (vi) large-scale mobilisation of Europe’s biomass resources, with power sector biomass consumption reaching at least 8.5 EJ in the most challenging year (compared with 1.9 EJ today), and (vii) increasing solid biomass and biogas capacity deployment to at least 4 GW y−1 and 6 GW y−1 respectively. We find that even when wind and solar photovoltaic capacity is installed in optimum locations, the total cost of a 100\% renewable power system (∼530 €bn y−1) would be approximately 30\% higher than a power system which includes other low-carbon technologies such as nuclear, or carbon capture and storage (∼410 €bn y−1). Furthermore, a 100\% renewable system may not deliver the level of emission reductions necessary to achieve Europe’s climate goals by 2050, as negative emissions from biomass with carbon capture and storage may still be required to offset an increase in indirect emissions, or to realise more ambitious decarbonisation pathways.},
