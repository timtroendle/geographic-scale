The report also evaluates the future costs of wind energy production across Europe in order to gauge the potential output at competitive rates.},

  abstract = {Reanalysis models are rapidly gaining popularity for simulating wind power output due to their convenience and global coverage. However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly proven. This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing NASA's MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50\% in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30\% in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2\%, with countries ranging from 19.5\% (Germany) to 32.4\% (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23\% more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3\%. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4\% and Germany's to 29.1\%.},

  abstract = {Against the background of the recent trend towards ever larger wind turbines at higher hub heights, this contribution determines the total technical potential and associated costs for electricity generation in Europe with large turbines, based on a GIS-based methodology employing cost-potential curves. For the EU28 and Europe technical potentials of 15~PWh/a and 20~PWh/a are determined respectively, with associated LCOEs (Levelized Costs of Electricity) of between 6 and 50 €ct/kWh and large variations between countries: the largest potentials and lowest generation costs are to be found in the UK, Poland and Sweden. The approximate required investment to meet national 2020 targets based on the National Renewable Energy Action Plans is estimated based on the model results. A comparison with the results of other studies shows significant deviations in the results, most of which can be explained through the differences in input parameters, and a comparison of the obtained results for Germany with those from a previous study under the same assumptions produced very similar results with a deviation of about 10\%. A sensitivity analysis showed that the results are only moderately sensitive to the assumed discount rate as well as the size of turbines available.},

In this chapter, we conduct a literature review on site selection of solar PV power plants. More than 50 papers are studied to identify the site suitability methodologies, decision criteria, and restriction factors, use of Multicriteria decision-making techniques, Geographical information system (GIS), and dealing with uncertainty in installing utility-size solar PV. The results of our study show that analytical hierarchy process and its extensions are the most common methodology, followed by overlay tool analysis in GIS environment. Solar PV site suitability studies considered solar irradiation amount as the most important criteria followed by the proximity to power lines and land slope, whereas the protected lands and watercourses considered the highest restriction factors described in the literature that should be taken into account when facilitating site selection for utility-scale solar PV projects. More than 80\% of studies are addressing grid-connected solar PV where China leads the site suitability studies followed by Spain and India. As per authors' knowledge, this is an original contribution to review site suitability methodologies, decision criteria, and restriction factors for the solar PV.},

  title = {Schweizerisches Speicherwasserkraftpotential infolge der Erhöhungen bestehender Talsperren},
  abstract = {In a first part, this work examines the potential of Swiss storage hydropower due to dam heightening. For each dam, the feasibility of dam heightening by 5\%, 10\% and 20\% of the existing dam height is investigated. Based on the reviews of the dam heightening options, the additional storage capacity is estimated for several scenarios. With dam heightening at 23 reservoirs, the additional storage capacity is 1058 Mio m3 and the additional winter energy production amounts 3.4 TWh. Another scenario takes into account dam heightening by 20\% of the existing dam height at 30 reservoirs. The additional storage capacity amounts 1530 Mio m3 and the winter energy production can be increased by 4.8 TWh. Due to the Energy Strategy 2050, in the year 2050 the needed additional winter energy production amounts between 3 and 7.7 TWh (Piot, 2014). Dam heightening has the potential to provide a considerably part of the needed additional winter energy production. In the second part of the thesis, dam heightening at the Gries gravity dam is considered in more detail. Dam heightening alternatives, by 5\%, 10\% and 20\% of the existing dam height, are investigated. Since the inflows are not sufficient to fill the extended reservoir each year, different locations for a compensation basin are examined. From an energy-policy point of view aiming at increasing the Swiss electricity production from hydropower in winter, the alternative with the highest additional storage capacity is selected for a more detailed study. Within the development of the preliminary project, the stability of the dam, the spillway, the waterway and the compensation basin are examined in more detail. The project costs are estimated at 48 million francs. Currently dam heightening at the Griessee is not economical but would be interesting if the market situation would change.},

The trade-offs that come with higher spatial detail between better exposure of transmission bottlenecks, exploitation of sites with good renewable resources (particularly wind power) and computational limitations are discussed. It is shown that solutions with no grid expansion beyond today's capacities are only around 20\% more expensive than with cost-optimal grid expansion.},

  abstract = {Deep decarbonization of the electricity sector can be provided by a high penetration of renewable sources such as wind, solar PV and hydro power. Flexibility from hydro and storage complements the high temporal variability of wind and solar, and transmission infrastructure helps the power balancing by moving electricity in the spatial dimension. We study cost-optimal highly-renewable Chinese power systems under ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets, by deploying a 31-node hourly-resolved techno-economic optimization model supported by a validated weather-converted 38-year-long renewable power generation and electricity demand dataset. With a new realistic reservoir hydro model, we find that if CO2 emission reduction goes beyond 70\%, storage facilities such as hydro, battery and hydrogen become necessary for a moderate system cost. Numerical results show that these flexibility components can lower renewable curtailment by two thirds, allow higher solar PV share by a factor of two and contribute to covering summer cooling demand. We show that expanding unidirectional high-voltage DC lines on top of the regional inter-connections is technically sufficient and more economical than ultra-high-voltage-AC-connected “One-Net” grid. Finally, constraining transmission volume from the optimum by up to 25\% does not push total costs much higher, while the significant need for battery storage remains even with abundant interconnectivity.},
