abstract: |
    Wind and solar power are available throughout Europe with sufficient resource to enable full electricity sector decarbonisation. However, the extent to which geographic integration from the regional to continental scale is necessary for this is still unclear. We here examine the cost and design of 497 regional, 33 national, and a single continental electricity system. We show that the uneven distribution of renewable resources and of flexibility options makes fully self-sufficient regional-scale systems 70% more expensive and 45% larger generation capacity wise than a continent-spanning system in which generation and transmission is concentrated in renewables-rich regions. However, if integrated in a continental grid, regional net self-sufficiency is only 20% more expensive than a fully optimised continent-wide system. Fully renewable and nationally or regionally self-sufficient electricity supply is possible and, if integrated in a larger grid, economically comparable at all levels.
