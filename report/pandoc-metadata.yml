abstract: |
    Renewable electricity resources are abundant across Europe, and the potential is sufficient to enable full electricity sector decarbonisation on different scales, from the regional to the continental, with self-sufficient or interconnected units. We show that a continental-scale, fully renewable electricity system is cheapest, but also that national- and regional-scale systems are both possible and can be designed to be similarly cost-efficient as the continental scheme, with 20% cost penalty or less. The key to low cost is transmission, but it is not necessary to vastly expand the transmission system: when electricity is transmitted only to balance fluctuations and not to generate electricity in distant parts of Europe, transmission needs are comparable to today’s. The largest differences concern land-use and social acceptance: in the continental system, generation/transmission assets are strongly on the European periphery where the best resources are, whereas regional systems have more dispersed generation near demand. The key trade-off for 100% renewable power in Europe is thus not scale vs. cost, but scale vs. technology mix and location.
highlights:
    - Fully renewable electricity supply is possible at all geographic scales in Europe.
    - Regionally balanced distribution of generation permits transmission and cost similar to today’s.
    - Strong trade-off between transmission and generation capacity.
    - International connections are important for low-cost electricity.
