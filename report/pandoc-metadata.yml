abstract: |
    The European potential of renewable electricity is sufficient to enable fully renewable supply on different scales, from self-sufficient, subnational regions to an interconnected continent. We show that a continental-scale system is cheapest, but also that systems on the national scale and below are possible at cost penalties of 20% or less. The key to low cost is transmission, but it is not necessary to vastly expand the transmission system. When electricity is transmitted only to balance fluctuations, its size is comparable to today’s albeit with expanded interconnector capacities. The largest differences across system designs concern land use and thus social acceptance: in the continental system, generation capacity is strongly concentrated on the European periphery where the best resources are. Regional systems, in contrast, have more dispersed generation. The key trade-off is therefore not the effect of geographic scale on cost, but on the spatial distribution of generation and transmission infrastructure.
highlights:
    - Continent-wide electricity supply is cheapest but needs large grid expansion.
    - Small-scale supply has only 20% higher cost, but needs more generation infrastructure.
    - Strong international connections are crucial for low cost systems.
    - Key trade-off is between geographic scale and distribution of infrastructure.
