abstract: |
    A renewable electricity system is a key enabler for Europe to meet its long-term climate obligations. We here show that cost and design of systems on different geographic scales depend on the availability of renewable resources and flexibility options to balance intermittent generation. Whereas fully renewable electricity supply is possible on all scales – continental, national, and regional – the total system cost of regionally self-sufficient electricity systems is 70% higher than those of a system spanning the European continent and they require 40% more total supply capacity. Cost and technology mix varies strongly between regions, making renewable self-sufficiency economically unattractive in many cases. Allowing for electricity trade between regions, even if net-trade is zero, greatly reduces cost to a level comparable to the continental supply. A global sensitivity analysis based on machine learning reveals that the trend in these findings is insensitive to technology cost uncertainty.
