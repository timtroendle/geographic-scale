    <mark>**(exceeding 150 words by 10 -- needs shortening)**</mark> How to design a feasible and fully renewable European electricity system is still an open question <mark>(IS IT?)</mark>. We here compare the cost and design of optimised systems for 497 sub-national, 33 national, and a single continental unit. The availability of renewable resources and of flexibility options to balance intermittent generation drives total system cost of regional-scale systems 70% higher than those of a continent-spanning system, with 40% more electricity generation capacity required. Regional net self-sufficiency within a continental-scale system lets cost increase by only 10-21%. The qualitative nature of these cost differences are insensitive to technology cost uncertainty, but financing cost of transmission expansion, as well as wind power and bioenergy cost influence the relative attractiveness of systems on different scales. Our results show possible trade-offs between cost and socially acceptable choices, for example, transmission expansion can be avoided by regional self-sufficiency. We thus suggest many feasible routes to a fully renewable European electricity supply exist for policymakers to choose from.
