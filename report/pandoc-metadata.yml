abstract: |
    Renewable electricity resources are abundant across Europe, and the potential is sufficient to enable full electricity sector decarbonisation on different scales, from the regional to the continental, with self-sufficient or interconnected units. We show that a continental-scale, fully renewable electricity system is cheapest, but also that national- and regional-scale systems are both possible and can be designed to be similarly cost-efficient as the continental scheme, with 20% cost penalty or less. The key to low cost is transmission, but it is not necessary to vastly expand the transmission system: when electricity is transmitted only to balance fluctuations and not to satisfy local demand using better resources in distant parts of Europe, transmission needs are comparable to today’s. The largest differences concern land-use and social acceptance: in the continental system, generation/transmission assets are strongly concentrated on the European periphery where the best resources are, whereas regional systems have more dispersed generation near demand. The key trade-off for 100% renewable power in Europe is thus not scale vs. cost, but scale vs. technology mix and location.
highlights:
    - Very different fully renewable designs are possible and economically comparable.
    - Transmission and cost of regionally balanced distribution of generation is possible at levels similar to today's.
    - Large generation capacity of small-scale supply can only be mitigated by transmission capacity.
    - International connections are important for low-cost renewable electricity.
