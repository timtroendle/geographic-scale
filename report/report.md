# Main text

A large body of work has shown that 100% or near-100% renewable electricity provision through solar, wind, and hydropower is technically possible and economically viable in Europe. Solar and wind generation technologies are increasingly mature [@Brown:2018; @IRENA:2019], there is enough land for the infrastructure required [@McKenna:2015; @Jacobson:2017; @Bodis:2019; @Trondle:2019; @Ruiz:2019], future cost will likely be similar to today’s cost [@Bussar:2014; @Connolly:2016; @Plessmann:2017; @Jacobson:2017; @Brown:2018; @Child:2019], and a variety of options is available to balance variable renewable generation on time scales ranging from hours to years [@Rasmussen:2012; @Luo:2015; @Grams:2017; @Schlachtberger:2017; @Brown:2018]. However, not every strategy is available on every geographical scale, as regions are endowed with different and differently large resources. Further, each strategy to deal with this variability leads to trade-offs across areas as diverse as cost, governance and political control, and landscape impacts [@Lilliestam:2016].

These tradeoffs depend on how the system is designed, and where on the spectrum between small-scale bottom-up and vast-scale top-down the key system elements are located. On one end of the spectrum are small-scale solutions, where renewable variability is balanced locally using electricity storage and the dispatchable resources available, or by supplementing variable generation with flexible biomass-based generation without the need for vast transmission structure. Such a locally self-sufficient future is in principle possible in Europe [@Trondle:2019], but how the flexibility supply affects the cost in all parts of Europe is not known. On the other end are large-scale solutions, relying on stochastic smoothing of supply through large grids, spanning an entire continent or more, making efficient use of dispatchable resources regardless of where they are located [@Patt:2011; @Dii:2012; @Grams:2017; @Mano:2014; @Benasla:2019]. Hence, there is reason to expect that a continent-spanning system is cheaper than smaller systems [@Schmid:2015; @Schlachtberger:2017; @Brown:2018a]. However, it is not known how large this cost difference is --- and as ideas of citizen power, small is beautiful, and local control have great appeal to many, citizens and decision-makers alike, the trade-off between geographic scale and cost is a real political question [@Schmidt:2012; @Scheer:2012; @100RESCommunities:2015; @FriendsoftheEarth:2018]. As the pathways to achieve them may be very different [@Foxon:2013; @Hughes:2013], the question of which path has which consequences is both important and pressing.

Here we investigate how the geographic scale of a fully renewable European electricity system affects cost and optimised design, that is, the technology mix and the spatial configuration of generation and transmission capacities. We investigate electricity systems on three scales: continental, national, and regional (the first-level administrative divisions). To quantify cost differences for systems on different geographic scales as well as the influence of spatial scale on optimised design, we develop a linear programming model that considers solar, wind, hydropower, and bioenergy, based on the Calliope framework [29]. Our model minimises system cost by simultaneously optimising design and operation of the electricity system. The model is spatially resolved to first-level administrative divisions (497 regions) and runs at a 4-hour temporal resolution. We perform a global sensitivity analysis based on a multi-fidelity sparse polynomial chaos expansion of the original model, permitting us to explore a large range of uncertainties and sensitivities despite the fact that the main model is computationally difficult to solve.

# System scale drives system cost

We first assess the impact of three different system scales on total system cost and find, as expected, that system cost increases when system scale decreases. For a continental scale system spanning the entire continent, the cost-optimised system configuration corresponds to about 0.05 EUR per kWh of electricity demand, which is comparable to today’s cost. In the national scale case, characterised by 33 isolated national grids, the cost rises to nearly 140% of the cost-optimised continental case. Decreasing the system scale even further, i.e. removing electricity trade between the 497 now isolated regions in Europe, rises cost to 170% of the continental case (Figure @fig:scenario-space a). System scale matters because a larger system covers a greater geographic area, and thus a greater variety of wind and solar resources, including higher-quality ones out of reach in cases with smaller scales. In addition, interconnecting that wider geographic area permits benefits from options such as hydropower and bioenergy to percolate across the entire European system, rather than just providing local benefits. The qualitative nature of this relationship is unaffected by cost uncertainties: When varying input cost assumptions, the resulting cost differences between system scales vary, but the continental scale system is always cheaper than the national scale system, which in turn is always cheaper than the regional scale one (Figure @fig:cost-uncertainty).

All cost values are relative to the continental case. **b**, Cost of cases with lower level net self-sufficiency within continental scale systems (left two columns) and within national scale systems (rightmost column). The cases include national and regional extents of net self-sufficiency (x-axis), in which countries or regions fulfil the largest part of their demand with electricity generated within the country or region. The cases also include different levels of allowed net imports (y-axis), from no net imports until imports covering up to 30% of national or regional electricity demand.](report/scenario-space.png){#fig:scenario-space .class}

To test the impact of access to better and more diverse renewable resources and of access to more and more diverse flexibility options on system cost, we also examine additional cases that enforce national and regional self-sufficiency within larger-scale systems. We examine nine cases of lower level self-sufficiency with either net-zero trade between countries or regions to help balance variability (bottom row in Figure @fig:scenario-space b), or with relaxed import restrictions permitting 15% or 30% of national or regional electricity demand to be met by net imports (middle and top rows in Figure @fig:scenario-space b). We find that net local self-sufficiency has a noticeable but small impact on cost: system cost rises to 106% for national self-sufficiency and to 121% for regional self-sufficiency in the continental scale system. Further relaxing import constraints to permit net imports also has only a minor impact on system cost: allowing for 30% net imports between countries within a continental system, for example, reduces cost from 106% of the base case cost to 102% (Figure @fig:scenario-space b). The effect of trade within otherwise unconnected countries is similarly small, resulting in a reduction from 147% to 142% of the base case cost. Thus, national or regional net self-sufficiency is not necessarily much more expensive than a fully optimised continental scale supply, if a sufficiently capable transmission grid can balance fluctuations of renewable generation. There is a strong trade-off between system scale and cost, but a smaller one between net self-sufficiency and cost.

# System scale drives deployed technology capacities

We now examine the impact of geographic scale on the deployment of supply, transmission and storage technologies, for the continental, national, and regional scales cases. Small scale systems require significantly more generation capacity than large-scale systems (Figure @fig:composition a), as many regional systems must rely on poor generation sites to meet their annual demand. Regional systems rely more on solar PV than on wind, as decent PV resources are available across the continent, but not every locality has good wind resources. Regional scale systems therefore have more installed capacity, but a lower generation potential than the continental scale system (Figure @fig:composition a,d). This increased investment need drives system cost, so that the supply of smaller systems is more expensive than that of larger ones.

![**Cost-optimised technology mixes for all cases. a,b,c,d**, Europe-wide installed generation capacities (**a**), storage capacities (**b**), transmission capacities (**c**), and  potential and curtailed generation from variable renewable sources (**d**) for base case continental, national, and regional scale electricity systems with minimal system cost. The thin bars indicate the range of values for the corresponding secondary cases with national and regional self-sufficiency within continental and national scale systems. See Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 for numeric results of all twelve cases. **a**, The total excludes all storage capacities but includes capacities of hydropower which are kept constant in all cases (36 GW run of river, 103 GW reservoirs). **b**, Europe-wide installed storage capacities for battery and hydrogen storage. 97 TWh from hydro reservoirs and 1.3 TWh from pumped hydro storage are kept constant in all cases and not shown. **c**, Europe-wide installed electricity transmission capacities, ignoring transmission capacities within regions. **d**, Europe-wide potential generation and curtailed generation from the variable renewable sources solar, wind and hydro.](report/composition.png){#fig:composition .class}

The largest effects concern storage, transmission, and flexible generation from biomass and there is a very strong trade-off between them. As the continental scale system relies on the grid to balance fluctuations, sometimes across large distances, it sees great expansion of the transmission grid to about 400 TWkm, some 4 times the current European transmission system [@ENTSO-E:2019]. Using this capacity, about 3,000 TWh/year cross country borders, which, again, is roughly 4 times current cross-border electricity flows and is comparable to the entire European electricity demand [@ENTSO-E:2019]. Of those 3,000 TWh, roughly half remain as net imports within countries, which is more than 7 times the amount of today [@ENTSO-E:2019].

Because they use the transmission grid to connect resources, larger electricity systems require fewer other flexibility options, such as dispatchable generation and storage, and require less curtailment than smaller-scale systems (see Figure @fig:composition). Larger systems generate the majority of their renewable electricity from onshore wind resources. There are two reasons for this. First, levelised cost of electricity of onshore wind at the best locations in Europe is low. Second, continental systems can exploit wind patterns across Europe on multiple timescales --- an effect known from the literature [@Kempton:2010; @Grams:2017]. This Europe-wide variability is comparatively smaller for photovoltaics [@Grams:2017].

When we examine national or regional net self-sufficiency in larger-scale systems, moving generation capacities towards demand, we see that the supply structure resembles that of national or regional scale systems (black bars in Figure @fig:composition). National or regional net self-sufficiency within a larger-scale system requires substantially higher wind and solar generation capacities, but only moderately more flexibility capacities. Thus, while large-scale systems with national or regional net self-sufficiency resemble national and regional scale systems on the supply side, they do not resemble them on the flexibility side. This explains the large cost differences between them: generation cost is roughly equal, but flexibility cost is much higher for small-scale systems.

When we consider uncertainty in twelve model inputs (see Supplementary Table 5), we find that the qualitative nature of the differences in installed capacity between continental, national, and regional scale systems is largely unaffected by these input uncertainties (Figure @fig:composition-uncertainty). We find that cost optimised national and regional scale systems always have more combined bioenergy and storage capacity, almost always have more total supply capacity, and often have less wind power capacity than cost-optimised continental scale systems. The impact of geographic scale on deployed technology capacities thus is robust towards these model uncertainties.

# System scale drives spatial distribution of technology deployment

Expanding renewables within the continental scale system is the least cost option for a fully renewable European power supply. Doing so, however, means that generation and transmission are unequally distributed across Europe.

In the continental scale system, peripheral regions generate electricity for the central parts of the continent. For example, Ireland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Albania generate more than 400% of their electricity demand, requiring a land area 3 times larger than necessary for their own needs. This effect is even more pronounced in single regions: several Irish counties facing the Atlantic ocean --- like Mayo, Kerry, or Cork ---, the Swedish island Gotland in the Baltic Sea, or Tulcea at the Romanian Black Sea coast generate over 50 times their own demand, with the rest being exported (Figure @fig:map-energy a). In contrast, other regions and countries rely heavily, or sometimes entirely, on imports: Belgium, Czech Republic, and Germany produce less than 10% of their electricity demand themselves. The spatial distribution is very sensitive to cost and resource assumptions, but the centralising trend due to the cost minimisation in the continental system, however, is not.

To enable this trade, power lines are needed, from the source to the importing regions, often crossing several regions and countries on the way. In extreme cases, over 250 times local demand is transferred through a node of the system, for example in some Irish counties passing electricity from wind farms on the coast to Wales and then onwards to England and the continent (Figure @fig:map-energy b). Similar effects are found in peripheral regions in the Baltic Sea region, Portugal, Romania and the Western Balkans. Large amounts of electricity are exported from and through these regions, which consequentially will experience large installations of transmission capacities from which most citizens do not benefit directly, raising questions of the social acceptability of such schemes.

The values are relative to local electricity demand.](report/map-energy.png){#fig:map-energy .class}

On the other end of the scale, when regional electricity systems are isolated, the levelised cost of electricity varies strongly between regions, depending on the available renewable resources (Figure @fig:map-cost). About 10% of regions (and a few countries) have cost below those of the continental case (blue regions in Figure @fig:map-cost). They all benefit from existing hydropower capacities which are kept constant and cost-free in our model (see Methods), sufficient to cover 40% or more of their peak demand with low cost hydropower. Another 10% of regions have costs at least double those of the continental case, and for half of them, costs are at least four times higher. These expensive regions share at least one of the following features: excessively large (existing) hydropower capacities, and low or no potential for wind power.

![**Spatial distribution of system cost normalised by demand for base case national and regional scale systems, relative to the lowest cost continental scale base case.** Each panel shows the Europe-wide relative system cost beneath the panel heading. **a**, Relative system cost for each country in the national scale system without any exchange of electricity between countries. **b**, Relative system cost for each region in the regional scale system without any exchange of electricity between regions.](report/map-cost.png){#fig:map-cost .class}

Because we force hydropower capacities to exist where they exist today (see Methods), regions with hydropower generation greatly exceeding local demand have high supply cost due to large curtailment and high fixed cost for operation and maintenance. This is the case for several mountainous and rural regions, in the Alps (e.g. Grisons, Valais, Valle d’Aosta) but also elsewhere, such as Nikšic in Montenegro or Jämtland in Sweden. Of course, this is an artefact of the regional scale: these large hydro capacities were built to power nations, not small, sparsely populated parts of these countries.

Several regions have low or no potential for wind capacities and thus their main source of electricity is the sun. As solar generation has strong seasonal fluctuations in Europe, these regions require more flexible generation from bioenergy or hydropower, or long-term electricity storage. Where the potentials for wind are low, cost of flexible generation and thus system cost is particularly high.

# Discount rate and cost of onshore wind power, bioenergy, and hydrogen energy drive uncertainty

To understand which model inputs are driving the uncertainty in differences between larger and smaller-scale systems, we perform a global sensitivity analysis. We find that the uncertainty of three input parameters explains almost the entire variability of the additional cost of national scale systems compared to the continental scale base case: discount rate and the overnight cost of bioenergy and onshore wind power (Figure @fig:sobol). The same three parameters explain variability in difference in technology deployment between the two cases, with some contribution by overnight cost of hydrogen energy capacity and of solar power. Uncertainties regarding the other parameters have very little effect on our results. Because we use a different method on the regional scale compared to the national and continental scales (see Method) we cannot analyse sensitivities of scale differences involving the regional scale.

The depreciation rate impacts transmission capacities the most, as power lines have very long lifetimes. Thus, the sensitivity towards depreciation rate and overnight cost of onshore wind power reflects their importance for the continental scale system: when transmission and wind energy become more expensive, a least cost continental system resembles more closely a national scale system without international connections. The sensitivity towards overnight cost of hydrogen energy capacity and --- more importantly --- towards overnight cost of bioenergy reflects the importance of seasonal balancing for the national scale system: here, seasonal fluctuations are more pronounced, and no other options to balance them exist. Thus, the differences in system cost and technology deployment between large-scale and small-scale systems are especially pronounced when depreciation rate and overnight cost of onshore wind power are low, and overnight cost of bioenergy and hydrogen energy capacity are high.

# Discussion and conclusions

We show that the geographic scale at which renewable electricity systems operate has a strong impact on the cost and design of the electricity system. Cost is lowest for a system on continental scale, higher on the national scale, and highest on the regional scale. The differences in cost come together with structural differences in the design of cost-optimised systems: a system spanning all Europe needs significantly fewer supply capacities, in particular solar, and significantly fewer capacities providing flexible generation. Primarily the latter causes higher cost of national and regional scale systems. The continental system requires much larger transmission capacities however --- roughly 4 times larger than today --- and generation capacities that are strongly concentrated in space. On the national and regional scales, transmission needs are comparable to today's (albeit with different configuration) and generation is dispersed over the continent.

The trade-off between local generation and cost can be relieved with national or regional net self-sufficiency within a continental or national scale system. We show that the design of such systems resembles the one of small-scale systems on the supply side: they require large total supply capacities and in particular large solar capacities. On the flexibility side however, they do not resemble small-scale systems, and instead of relying on storage and bioenergy capacities they use their transmission grid connection to balance renewable fluctuations. Consequently, net self-sufficiency on the continental scale, but also on the national scale system are only slightly more expensive than their unconstrained counterparts.

Our findings are robust with respect to uncertainty in input parameters. Qualitatively, the relationship between geographic scale, cost, and design remains the same, no matter the combination of cost parameters we test. The strength of the effect, however, varies: in some cases national scale systems are only slightly more expensive and need only slightly more total supply, storage, and bioenergy capacity than continental systems. In some other cases, we find a much stronger effect leading for example to regional system cost as high as two times the continental system one's. These extreme cases are less likely but describe the range of possible options due to uncertainty in model parameters. Discount rate and overnight cost of onshore wind and bioenergy capacities are the prevailing parameters in the relationship between geographic scale, cost, and design.

Four aspects which our analysis does not consider may impact our findings. First, ignoring flexibilities stemming from the electricity demand or from coupling the electricity sector with the heat and transport sectors may leave small-scale systems worse off in our study than they actually are. Based on the results of the sensitivity analysis, major contributions are more likely if these flexibilities are able to balance seasonal fluctuations. This is likely not the case for demand flexibility [@Aryandoust:2017] or transportation [@Brown:2018a], but it may be possible by coupling the electricity and the heat sectors [@Brown:2018a]. Second, necessary ancillary services may be easier and thus less costly provided in smaller-scale systems, but there is no reason to believe that this would change system cost --- especially relative system cost --- significantly [@Brown:2018]. Third, cost of the distribution grid, on the other side, is likely to be higher for smaller systems with generation being dispersed more strongly, and in particular dispersed within the distribution grid [@ImperialCollegeLondon:2014]. Lastly, realisable potentials for solar and wind generation are likely to be lower than the vast technical potential we are considering in this study [@Trondle:2019]. Lower potentials will likely make electricity provision in small-scale systems more expensive and it will make self-sufficiency impossible in more than the five regions in which self-sufficiency is impossible in our study. For a more comprehensive discussion of these four impacts, see Supplementary Note 2.

Our findings imply that fully renewable electricity supply is feasible on all geographic scales, from continental via national down to regional. While cost and required supply and flexibility capacities increase with smaller scales, these aspects are not prohibitive but instead provide a trade-off with the required level of cooperation and transmission capacity on larger scales. Our findings thus add to existing policy knowledge that also smaller-scale systems can provide low cost, fully renewable, and secure electricity supply.

# Methods

We model a possible future European electricity system as a set of network nodes and power flows between the nodes, with each node representing a regional administrative unit in Europe. We consider the deployment of renewable electricity supply and storage technologies at each node, and the deployment of transmission links between nodes, but disregard subordinate network nodes and power flows on the distribution system. With the exception of hydro run-of-river, hydro reservoir, and pumped storage hydro plants, we do not consider current legacy generation capacities or the current topology of the transmission system. Thus our model represents almost entirely a greenfield system. We use this approach in order to understand the effect of system scale and size irrespective of the influence of legacy generation.

Using the Calliope model framework [@Pfenninger:2018b], we build a linear programming model that simultaneously optimises electricity system design and operation for a single weather year, 2016, with a temporal resolution of four hours. We choose a single year to reduce problem size, but we test this choice by also modelling the weather years 2007--2016 in a sensitivity analysis (see below). The objective function of the model is to find the design with the lowest total system cost. An electricity system design is defined by a set of supply capacities at each node, storage capacities at each node, and transmission capacities between all nodes. All system designs fulfilling Kirchhoff’s law, the technical constraints of all possible technology components, and political constraints (see below) are possible. We assume that electricity generation from photovoltaics, on- and offshore wind, and hydropower plants can be curtailed, i.e. the model can decide to lower actual generation at a certain point in time from the maximum generation given by the capacity factor time series described below.

The model code and all analysis steps are publicly available as a reproducible workflow (TODO publish and add DOI). While the following text describes the modelling choices and assumptions made, the entirety of the model and all embedded assumptions are available for inspection through the repository linked to above.

## Geographic scope and transmission grid

The study area comprises all countries represented by member organisations in the ENTSO-E: the EU-28, Norway, Switzerland, and Western Balkan countries. We exclude Iceland which is electricity autarkic, Cyprus, which is not directly connected to the rest of the study area, and Malta, for which insufficient data are available. We divide the study area into 497 regional administrative units [@Trondle:2019], each of which is considered to be a transmission network node. We model the transmission grid as direct net transfer capacities between network nodes, i.e. we consider net power flows on the shortest distances between nodes only, and assume the distribution network within each node is able to handle distribution load. We allow transmission capacities between regional administrative units sharing a land border. We use currently existing sea connections and those that are currently under construction to connect regions that do not share a land border [@ENTSO-E:2019a]. We furthermore connect the islands Hiiu and Saare to the Estonian mainland, resulting in a fully connected electricity network graph as visible in Supplementary Figure 1.

## System scale and self-sufficiency degree

We use two types of political constraints as the basis for our system layouts. First, constraints on the geographic scale of the electricity system, and second, constraints regarding the extent and degree of self-sufficiency. When we limit the scale of the system to be continental, national, or regional, we enforce zero electricity transmission capacities between continents, countries, or regions. For the continental size, this is given inherently by the scope of our study area.

With regards to the degree of self-sufficiency, we enforce national or regional self-sufficiency to different degrees, by forcing all or parts of the electricity demand in a given country or region to be satisfied with local electricity generation from wind, sun, biomass, and water. In contrast to the constraint on system scale, the grid can still be used to balance fluctuations, as long as the required threshold for net local generation is met. We quantify this relaxation of self-sufficiency by the percentage of net import allowance.

## Electrical load

We determine electrical load profiles for each regional administrative unit following the method described in @Trondle:2019. First, we derive the location and annual demand of industrial facilities with highest electricity demand in Europe from emission data of the European Emission Trading Scheme [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2018]. We assume industrial load to be nearly constant and thus derive flat industry profiles for each regional administrative unit.

Second, we use measured national load profiles of 2016 [@Muehlenpfordt:2019] (for Albania no 2016 data is available and thus we use 2017 data) and subtract industrial demand to retrieve national profiles of residential and commercial load. We then assume residential and commercial load to be spatially distributed proportional to population counts. Using the Global Human Settlement Population Grid with a resolution of 250 m [@JRC:2015] we allocate residential and commercial load to regional administrative units.

Finally, we sum the two industrial and residential time series in each administrative unit to retrieve electricity load profiles at each network node.

## Photovoltaics

Photovoltaics (PV) can be built at each network node. For each administrative unit, we first determine the maximum amount of capacity that can be deployed. Then, we determine the capacity factor time series which maps from installed capacity to electricity generation at each point in time.

Our model differentiates between PV deployed on open fields and on roof tops and uses geospatial data with a 10 arcsecond resolution. We allow open field PV to be built on areas of bare land [@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010] or open vegetation [@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010] that are not environmentally protected [@UNEP-WCMC:2018], not inhabited (i.e. < 1% of the grid cell are buildings or urban greens according to @Ferri:2017), and whose average slope [@Reuter:2007; @Danielson:2011] is 10° at maximum [@AlGarni:2018]. We assume a capacity density of 80 W/m^2^ to derive the maximum amount of installable open field PV capacity for all regional administrative units.

To determine the maximum installable capacity of roof mounted PV, we consider inhabited areas only (i.e. >= 1% of the grid cell are buildings or urban green areas according to @Ferri:2017). Within those grid cells, we use building footprints from @Ferri:2017 as a proxy for the amount of available roof tops. Using the high-resolution Sonnendach.ch data set for Switzerland [@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018], we find that within Switzerland, the ratio between building footprints from @Ferri:2017 and rooftops available for PV deployment is 0.56. Due to the lack of comparable data for other countries, we apply this ratio for all of Europe to derive the maximum amount of roof space available for PV. We further differentiate between roof space on flat roofs and on tilted roofs based on the ratio from @SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018 and assume capacity densities of 160 W/m^2^ for tilted roofs and 80 W/m^2^ for flat roofs.

We derive capacity factor time series for roof mounted and open-field PV on a regular grid with 50 km edge length, resulting in around 2700 time series covering the study area. We assume a performance ratio of 90% and simulate the time series using Renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016; @Pfenninger:2016]. For roof mounted PV, because tilt and orientation of tilted roofs have a significant impact on capacity factors, we model 16 different deployment situations covering roofs facing east, south, west, and north, with tilts between 18° and 43°. We calculate a weighted average from the resulting 16 time series based on the distribution of roofs from @SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018 to derive a single time series for roof mounted PV for each 50 km grid cell. For open field PV we optimise the tilt based on location [@Jacobson:2018], so each 50 km grid cell has a single time series. By computing the weighted spatial average across grid cells whose centroid lies within a given administrative unit, we finally compute a single open field PV and a single roof mounted PV time series for each administrative unit.

## Wind on- and offshore

Onshore and offshore wind capacities can be deployed at each network node, and we apply a method similar to the one for photovoltaics to derive their maximum amount of installable capacities and their capacity factor time series.

We use geospatial data with 10 arcsecond resolution to derive the maximum amount of installable wind power capacities. We allow onshore wind farms to be built on areas with farmland, forests, open vegetation, and bare land [@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010] that are not environmentally protected [@UNEP-WCMC:2018], not inhabited (i.e. < 1% of the grid cell are buildings or urban greens according to @Ferri:2017), and whose average slope [@Reuter:2007; @Danielson:2011] is 20° at maximum [@McKenna:2015]. We allow offshore wind farms to be built in offshore areas within Exclusive Economic Zones [@Claus:2018] with water depths [@Amante:2009] not below 50 m and which are not environmentally protected [@UNEP-WCMC:2018]. We assume capacity densities of 8 W/m^2^ and 15 W/m^2^ [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] for onshore and offshore wind. Where land is available for onshore wind farms and open field PV, either technology or a mix of both technologies can be used. We allocate the installable offshore capacities to those administrative units which share a coast with the Exclusive Economic Zone, and where there is more than one region, we allocate the capacities proportional to the length of the shared coast. We do not explicitly model the transmission network expansion needed to connect offshore farms.

We derive capacity factor time series for on- and offshore wind on the same 50 km^2^ grid as we do for PV, resulting in around 2700 onshore grid cells and around 2800 offshore grid cells. We again use Renewables.ninja [@Staffell:2016; @Pfenninger:2016] to simulate wind generation at each grid cell, assume capacity factors to be constant within the cell, and generate a spatially weighted average to generate a capacity factor time series for each regional administrative unit.

## Hydro run-of-river and reservoirs

We assume hydro run-of-river and hydro reservoir potentials to be largely tapped today [@LacalArantegui:2014] with almost no expansion potential. Thus, for hydro generation capacities we deviate from the greenfield approach and fix today's capacities.

We derive the location and installed power and storage capacities of hydro stations in Europe today from the JRC Hydro Power Database [@MatteoDeFelice:2019]. Where no storage capacity of hydro reservoirs is available, we use the median national ratio of power to storage capacity, and if that is not available, we use the median Europe-wide ratio of power to storage capacity.

To create power generation time series for each station, we use a two-stage approach. First, we derive water inflow time series for each station using an approach based on ERA5 runoff data [@Dee:2011] and hydrological basins [@Lehner:2013] described and validated for China in [@Liu:2019]. We use Atlite [@Andresen:2015] to first determine all basins upstream of the hydropower station to be able to sum all upstream runoff while assuming a water flow speed of 1 m/s.

Second, we apply bias correction factors based on annual generation necessary for this method to represent the actual magnitude of the inflow and thus accurately model power generation. As we do not have data per station, we use national generation data from IRENA [@IRENA:2018a]. For hydro run-of-river plants we assume constant annual capacity factors within each country, which allows us to estimate the annual generation per plant. We use this estimation to derive electricity generation time series for each plant by scaling and capping the water inflow time series such that they sum to the annual generation without ever exceeding power capacities of the stations. For hydro reservoirs, we additionally assume they never need to spill water, i.e. their storage capacity is sufficient to use all inflowing water. We then scale the water inflow time series in such a way that they sum to the annual generation of the stations.

Using location data of each plant, we sum up time series as well as power and storage capacities per regional administrative unit. Our total resulting capacities are 36 GW for run-of-river and 103 GW / 97 TWh for reservoirs.

## Bioenergy

We use estimations of biomass potentials for the year 2020 and reference assumptions taken from @RuizCastello:2015, but we assume no dedicated farming for energy crops and thus consider residuals and wastes only. The data is given as national aggregates, and we use national shares of farmland [@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010], national shares of forests [@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010], and national shares of population [@JRC:2015] as proxies to derive proportionally allocated potentials per regional administrative unit. Supplementary Table 1 lists all feedstocks we consider together with the allocation proxy we use.

We assume an efficiency of 45% for the combustion of all biomass.

## Pumped storage hydro

Similar to hydro run-of-river and hydro reservoir capacities, we assume pumped storage hydro capacities in Europe to be largely tapped [@LacalArantegui:2014] and do not allow for capacity expansion. Thus, we deploy today's pumped hydropower and storage capacities. We assume a round-trip electricity efficiency of 78% [@Schmidt:2019].

To determine location, power and storage capacity of each pumped hydro station in Europe today, we also use the JRC Hydro Power Database [@MatteoDeFelice:2019]. Where storage capacities are missing, we employ the same method as for hydro reservoirs: we assume national median ratios of power to storage capacity for all stations with missing storage capacity; and where this is not available, we assume Europe-wide median ratios of power to storage capacity. The storage capacities from the JRC Hydro Power Database sum up to more than 10 TWh, which is an order of magnitude above the 1.3 TWh reported by @Geth:2015. To ensure that we do not overestimate the pumped storage potential we therefore scale storage capacities to match national data reported by @Geth:2015. Using location data of each station, we then sum all power and storage capacities within regional administrative units to form a single pumped hydro capacity per unit.

## Short-term and long-term storage

We assume that short-term and long-term storage capacities can be deployed in all regional administrative units. We model short-term storage as Lithium-ion batteries and assume long-term storage is provided by hydrogen, as they are likely to become the dominant technology in their respective applications [@Schmidt:2019]. The models are based on two technical parameters: the ratio between power and storage capacity, and the round-trip efficiency. Short-term storage is constrained to a maximum capacity of 4 h of full power, while long-term storage has a minimum of 4 h capacity at full power. We assume 86% of round-trip efficiency for short-term and 40% for long-term storage.

Additionally, we assume that power and storage capacities can be expanded independently, constrained only by the above mentioned minimum and maximum storage capacities.

## Insufficient potentials

In some regions, local technical potential for renewable electricity is not high enough to satisfy local electricity demand [@Trondle:2019]. This is problematic in system layouts in which regions strive for self-sufficiency. To provide sufficient electricity supply in these regions, we connect them with a neighbouring or the encompassing region: Vienna with Lower Austria, Brussels with Flanders, Berlin with Brandenburg, Oslo with Akershus, and Basel-City with Basel-Country. For the regional scale system, but also for continental and national scale systems with regional self-sufficiency, we therefore require self-sufficiency of each combined region in these five corner cases.

## Technology cost

We assess the long term (quasi steady state) cost of electricity supply. We aim neither to determine the cost of a transition to a future system nor to consider disruptive developments on the global market for supply and storage technologies. Thus, our cost are based on expected learning rates and the assumption that renewable generation and electricity storage technologies will have been deployed at cumulative capacities consistent with our study. Cost estimates for the year 2050 are primarily from [@JRC:2014] for supply and transmission technologies, from [@Schmidt:2019] for storage technologies, and from [@RuizCastello:2015] for fuel cost of bioenergy. See Supplementary Table 2 for an overview of all cost assumptions.

Technology cost is modelled as the sum of overnight capacity cost, annual maintenance cost based on installed capacity, and variable cost per unit of generated electricity. For solar and wind we assume a small variable cost of 0.1 €ct / kWh to encourage curtailment whenever generation potential is higher than demand and storage capacities. We subtract these variable cost from the fixed operation and maintenance cost based on average capacity factors, so that they do not increase the overall cost of solar or wind technologies. For all hydropower technologies, we consider annual maintenance and variable cost only, since we assume that maximum capacities are already built today, so overnight cost of hydropower has no impact on our results.

Technology lifetime and cost of capital are used to derive annuities for each technology. We assume cost of capital to be 7.3% for all technologies and all locations based on historic average cost of capital for OECD countries [@Steffen:2019]. Some recent literature suggests cost of capital are likely specific to technology [@Egli:2018; @Steffen:2019] and location [@Ondraczek:2015; @Steffen:2019], but we consider the data available so far too sparse to provide a solid basis on which to model this.

## Sensitivity to meteorological conditions

While we use only a single year of meteorological conditions, 2016, in the analysis of system layouts described in the article, we use ten years, 2007--2016, to analyse the sensitivity of our results to meteorological conditions impacting generation from wind and solar power. We re-run the model with the full ten years of data considered for the optimisation. In this way, we are not assessing the variability between meteorological years, but we are assessing how much the result changes when considering a wider range of meteorological conditions.

We are interested in the sensitivity of one of the main outputs of our study: relative total system cost of the national scale system using the continental scale system as a baseline. Because computational requirements to solve a model with regional spatial resolution and temporal resolution of 4h for ten years are too high, we perform this sensitivity analysis using a model with national spatial resolution while keeping temporal resolution the same. Comparing the results between national and regional resolution for the case with only one year of meteorological conditions, we find a difference of 8% for the relative cost of the national scale system.

The additional cost of the national scale system compared to the continental scale system, however, is unaffected by the longer time duration: the difference to the case with only one year is negligible (< 1‰). This is not to say that cost and design of the electricity system is not sensitive to meteorological conditions. In fact, we find that total system cost is generally slightly higher, and more wind and bioenergy capacities are deployed in exchange of solar capacities. However, large-scale and small-scale systems are impacted similarly and so the difference between both is unaffected by the longer time duration of considered meteorological conditions. These results justify the use of only a single meteorological year.

## Sensitivity to technology cost

We furthermore assess the uncertainty of our results stemming from uncertainty of technology cost. While we do know current cost and we do know it is likely to fall with deployment due to learning effects, we do not know exact future cost with certainty. This uncertainty stems primarily from two sources. We do not know the deployment rates of renewable technologies and we do not know how much cost will fall with deployment. In our analysis, we are assuming that renewable technologies are heavily deployed, so we focus on the second uncertainty: the relationship between deployment and cost reductions. Since we perform cost minimisation, the absolute total system cost of any assessed electricity system layout can be sensitive to the cost of its constituent technologies, as shown for example in @Moret:2017.

We assess the sensitivity of differences in system cost and technology deployment between large and small-scale system layouts. We consider as uncertain parameters the cost of ten different technologies, the weighted cost of capital, and the availability of biomass for combustion. Following a maximum entropy approach, we model their uncertainty with uniform distributions over ranges taken from the literature (see Supplementary Table 5). We perform a global sensitivity analysis of system cost and several other model outputs in this twelve dimensional space. This allows us to derive the distribution of each model output and it allows us to derive total and first-order Sobol' indices. The Sobol' indices determine the share of the variation of each output that is explained by the variation of each input. Building on this, we use the indices to rank input parameters based on their importance for the uncertainty of each output.

To derive the output distribution and Sobol' indices, we need to let parametric uncertainty propagate into and through the model. In a classical Monte Carlo simulation, the input distributions are sampled many times to derive samples of the output. Because of the high computational requirements, in particular the time our model takes to run, this approach would be prohibitive for our study. Thus, we employ a method described in refs. @Sudret:2008 and @LeGratiet:2017 to perform a polynomial chaos expansion of our original model to derive a surrogate model. We use the available of this method in the MATLAB package UQLab [@Marelli:2014]. From this surrogate model, Sobol' indices can be determined analytically and the distribution of the outputs can be derived using Monte Carlo sampling. We derive the surrogate model by sampling 150 times from the input parameters using maximin Euclidean-distance-optimised Latin Hypercube Sampling, and by running continental, national, and regional scale models each once for each input parameter vector. Due to the high computational requirements of running national and continental scale models, we perform these runs on a spatial resolution with low fidelity in which each country represents one transmission grid node. To remove the biases these low fidelity model runs inhibit, we perform 10 additional runs on the original, high-fidelity resolution and use a multi-fidelity approach to retrieve a single surrogate model for continental and national scales. The estimated empirical error of the surrogate model is below 5% and thus we deem the surrogate sufficiently accurate to derive total- and first-order Sobol' indices.
