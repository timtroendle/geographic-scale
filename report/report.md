# Introduction

To fulfil its commitment under the Paris climate agreement, Europe must eliminate electricity sector emissions. For this, future electricity supply will be based largely, or entirely, on renewable sources[@IPCC:2018]. Although ambitious, this is possible because solar and wind generation technologies are mature[@Brown:2018; @IRENA:2019], their generation potential is sufficient[@McKenna:2015; @Jacobson:2017; @Bodis:2019; @Trondle:2019; @Ruiz:2019], various options are available to balance variable renewable generation on time scales ranging from hours to years[@Rasmussen:2012; @Luo:2015; @Grams:2017; @Schlachtberger:2017; @Brown:2018], and systems relying on them can have similar cost as today’s system[@Bussar:2014; @Connolly:2016; @Plessmann:2017; @Jacobson:2017; @Brown:2018; @Child:2019]. As renewables are abundantly available across the continent, very different kinds of future electricity system designs are possible, from a Europe-wide electricity grid sharing generation resources among all countries, to myriads of locally self-sufficient units, either disconnected or with limited interconnection, as well as combinations of these two extremes[@Battaglini:2009; @Blarke:2013]. Here, we investigate the impact on cost and cost-optimised system design of decarbonising Europe’s electricity supply using renewables on different geographic scales and with different degrees of self-sufficiency.

The European energy transition is highly politicised and citizen engagement is one of its historical drivers[@Lilliestam:2016]. Ideas of decentralisation, energy democracy,  and local control have great appeal to many citizens and decision-makers, leading to calls for regionally self-sufficient systems based on local resources[@Schmidt:2012; @Scheer:2012; @100RESCommunities:2015; @FriendsoftheEarth:2018]. In such systems, generation variability would be balanced locally using electricity storage and locally available dispatchable resources, without the need for new transmission infrastructure. The annual renewable potential for local self-sufficiency is large enough in most of Europe[@Trondle:2019], but it is not known how balancing of fluctuations on smaller time-scales affects cost and the system design in different regions.

Proponents of a continent-spanning supply system, in contrast, point to the cost-reducing impact of sharing the best renewable resources and of relying on stochastic smoothing of supply fluctuations through large grids, while making efficient use of dispatchable resources regardless of where they are located[@Patt:2011; @Dii:2012; @Grams:2017; @Mano:2014; @Benasla:2019]. Indeed, previous research has shown that these effects make a continent-spanning renewables-based system cheaper than smaller systems[@Schmid:2015; @Schlachtberger:2017; @Brown:2018a].

Previous work however changed system designs along two dimensions simultaneously: supply scale and balancing scale. We define supply scale as the geographic extent within which systems are net self-sufficient, and balancing scale as the geographic extent within which net self-sufficient systems can balance renewable fluctuations. By varying both simultaneously, past work is unable to attribute increasing cost and decreasing transmission requirements to access to better renewable resources, access to dispatchable resources, or stochastic smoothing in large grids. It is furthermore not clear whether self-sufficiency is necessarily more expensive in smaller than larger systems. Indeed, it seems possible that the cost penalty of smaller-scale self-sufficiency can be mitigated through appropriate system design.

Here we model fully renewable European electricity systems and vary supply scale and balancing scale independently across continental, national, and regional levels. This allows us, for example, to consider net self-sufficient regional electricity systems which use the entire continent to balance their local supply. We use a cost-minimising linear programming model that considers solar, wind, hydropower, and bioenergy, based on the _Calliope_ framework[@Pfenninger:2018b]. It is spatially resolved to first-level administrative divisions (497 regions) and runs at a 4-hour temporal resolution. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis based on a multi-fidelity sparse polynomial chaos expansion of the original model, permitting us to explore a large range of uncertainties despite the main model being computationally difficult to solve (see Methods).

# System scale drives system cost

We first assess the impact of three different system scales on total system cost and find that there is a strong trade-off between balancing scale and cost, but only a weak trade-off between supply scale and cost ({@fig:cost}). As expected, system cost increases when either supply or balancing scale decreases. System scale matters mainly because interconnecting a wider geographic area allows dispatchable generation options such as hydropower and bioenergy to percolate across the entire European system, lowering the total balancing cost. Further, a geographically larger supply system covers a greater geographic area, and thus a greater variety of wind and solar resources, including higher-quality ones out of reach in smaller-scale cases. For an entirely continental-scale system, in which supply and balancing of supply spans the entire continent, the cost-optimised system configuration corresponds to about 0.05\ EUR per kWh of electricity demand, which is comparable to today’s cost. Limiting the net supply options to those available within countries or regions increases cost relative to the continental case to 106% and 121%. When we additionally decrease the balancing scale to the national level, reaching 33 isolated national systems, the costs sharply increase to 139% (national supply and balancing) and 147% (regional supply, national balancing). With balancing of supply on the lowest scale, i.e. disabling electricity trade between the 497 now isolated regions in Europe, raises cost to 170% of the continental case ({@fig:cost}). The main cost driver of these small, isolated systems is the limited access to regionally concentrated balancing options like hydropower, but also the impossibility to share the best wind and solar resources among regions. Allowing for net imports hardly affects cost (see Supplemental Note 2), again emphasising that balancing rather than supply resource quality is the main source of cost reduction in larger systems. Therefore, local electricity generation must not be substantially more expensive than a continental-scale supply, if such regionally net self-sufficient units are interconnected through the transmission grid to balance the fluctuating renewable generation.

![**System cost of six electricity systems in Europe with supply and balancing of supply on three different scales, relative to lowest cost, continental-scale system.** In all six cases, net supply is generated (x-axis) and balanced (y-axis) either on the entire continent, within countries, or within regions. Systems on the diagonal are entirely continental, national, or regional scale with no trade between units on the respective scale. Systems below the diagonal are net self-sufficient (zero trade balance over a whole year) on their respective supply scale with trade for balancing between units on this scale.](report/cost.svg){#fig:cost .class}

The relationship between system scale and cost is unaffected by cost uncertainties. When varying input cost assumptions using surrogate models fitted to the main optimisation model (see Methods), the resulting cost differences between system scales vary, but the entirely continental-scale system is always cheaper than the entirely national-scale system, which in turn is always cheaper than the entirely regional-scale one (@fig:cost-uncertainty).

For each scale, 100,000 samples are obtained with surrogate models fitted to the main optimisation model. Darker colours indicate more occurrences of values within these 100,000 samples. System cost is normalised by the cost of the continental base case ({@fig:cost}). For a detailed description of all assessed input uncertainty, see Table\ S1.](report/cost-uncertainty.png){#fig:cost-uncertainty .class}

# System scale drives technology deployment

Geographic scale strongly affects the deployment of generation, transmission, and storage technologies with respect to both total amount and type of capacity deployed. Systems with supply and balancing on small scales require more generation capacity than larger-scale ones ({@fig:composition}a), as they must often rely on poorer local renewable resources to meet their annual demand. Entirely regional-scale systems rely more on solar than on wind, as solar resources are more evenly distributed across the continent than wind resources. These systems thus require more installed capacity than the entirely continental-scale system does, while their potential renewable generation is slightly lower ({@fig:composition}a,d). This additional generation capacity investment needed in smaller-scale systems is one driver of their higher system cost.

![**Cost-optimised technology mixes for all cases. a,b,c,d**, Europe-wide installed generation capacities (**a**), storage capacities (**b**), transmission capacities (**c**), and  potential and curtailed generation from variable renewable sources (**d**) for entirely continental-, national-, and regional-scale electricity systems with minimal system cost. The thin bars indicate the range of values including cases with supply on smaller scales. See Tables\ S2 and S3 for numerical results of all cases. **a**, The total excludes all storage capacities but includes capacities of hydropower which we keep constant in all cases (36\ GW run of river, 103\ GW reservoirs). **b**, Europe-wide installed storage capacities for battery and hydrogen storage. 97\ TWh from hydro reservoirs and 1.3\ TWh from pumped hydro storage are kept constant in all cases and not shown. **c**, Europe-wide installed electricity transmission capacities, ignoring transmission capacities within regions. **d**, Europe-wide potential generation and curtailed generation from the variable renewable sources solar, wind and hydro.](report/composition.svg){#fig:composition .class}

Another driver is that different system scales rely on completely different structures of flexibility provision to balance intermittent generation. The entirely continental-scale system primarily relies on the transmission grid to balance fluctuations, often across large distances, with a grid expansion to about 400\ TWkm ({@fig:composition}c), roughly four times the current European transmission system[@ENTSO-E:2019]. Using this capacity, about 3,000\ TWh/year of electricity crosses country borders, which, again, is roughly four times current cross-border electricity flows and is comparable to the entire European electricity demand[@ENTSO-E:2019]. Of those 3,000\ TWh, roughly half remain as net imports within countries, which is more than seven times the amount of today[@ENTSO-E:2019].

Because they use the transmission grid to connect and balance resources, larger electricity systems require less dispatchable generation, storage, and curtailment than smaller-scale systems (@fig:composition). Larger systems generate the majority of their renewable electricity from onshore wind resources for two reasons. First, the cost of onshore wind at the best locations in Europe is very low and, with a continental grid, these excellent wind resources can be used across the continent. Second, continental systems can exploit wind patterns across Europe on multiple timescales, thereby strongly reducing aggregated wind fleet fluctuations and the need for additional balancing. This effect has been confirmed previously[@Kempton:2010; @Grams:2017], and is substantially smaller for photovoltaics[@Grams:2017].

The identified system designs are based on systems with supply and balancing on the same geographic scales. To attribute the system effects to either supply or balancing, we keep the balancing scale constant and assess system designs on smaller supply scales (black bars in @fig:composition). As expected, supply scale mainly affects the supply side of the system: decreasing scales increases total generation capacity, and especially solar capacity. However, it also leads to significantly smaller transmission capacities. The flexibility side, i.e. capacities of bioenergy, battery, and hydrogen, is largely unaffected by variations in the supply scale and mainly driven by balancing scale. These relationships explain the cost-increasing characteristics of both scales and their differences. Additional flexibility necessary on small balancing scales is more costly than additional supply necessary on small supply scales.

The differences in system structure and capacity deployment between continental-, national-, and regional-scale systems are unaffected by input uncertainties (@fig:composition-uncertainty and Table\ S1). Cost-optimised entirely national- and regional-scale systems always have more combined bioenergy and storage capacity, and almost always have more total supply capacity and less wind power capacity than cost-optimised entirely continental-scale systems.

# System scale drives spatial distribution of technology deployment

Expanding renewables using a continental-scale supply is the least-cost option, but doing so means that generation and transmission are unequally distributed across Europe. In the continental-scale supply system, peripheral regions generate electricity for the central parts of the continent. For example, Ireland, Lithuania, Estonia, and Albania generate more than 400% of their own electricity demand, requiring a land area 4 times larger than necessary for their own needs. This effect is even more pronounced in single regions: several Irish counties facing the Atlantic ocean --- like Mayo, Kerry, or Cork ---, the Baltic Sea islands Gotland and Saaremaa, or Tulcea at the Romanian Black Sea coast generate over 50 times their own demand, with the rest being exported ({@fig:map-energy}a). In contrast, other regions and countries rely strongly, or sometimes entirely, on imports: Belgium, Czech Republic, and Germany, for example, produce less than 10% of their own electricity demand. The spatial distribution is sensitive to cost and resource assumptions, as minimisation moves the bulk of generation to locations with best conditions, even if the difference to the second best location is minor; yet, the finding that generation capacity is centralised in the continental-scale supply system is robust.

![**Spatial distribution of generation and transmission relative to demand for each region in Europe in three systems with continental-scale balancing. a,b,c,** Electricity generated using a continental-scale (**a**), national-scale (**b**), and regional-scale (**c**) supply. **d,e,f** Electricity transmitted using a continental-scale (**d**), national-scale (**e**), and regional-scale (**f**) supply. All values are relative to local electricity demand.](report/map-energy.png){#fig:map-energy .class}

To enable this trade, a continent-spanning transmission system is needed. In extreme cases, over 250 times the local demand is transferred through a region, for example in southern Ireland, where electricity from coastal wind farms is transferred to Wales and then onwards to England and central Europe ({@fig:map-energy}d). Similar effects are found in peripheral regions in the Baltic Sea region, Portugal, Romania and the Western Balkans. Large amounts of electricity are exported from and through these regions, requiring correspondingly large transmission capacities from which most citizens do not benefit directly, raising questions of the social acceptability of such schemes.

Generation and transmission are more homogeneously distributed for national-scale ({@fig:map-energy}b,e) and regional-scale ({@fig:map-energy}c,f) supply. In the national case, most generation hot spots remain, but their extent is smaller as they only supply national, not continental, demand. In the regional case, the generation pattern changes radically as each region generates electricity to cover its own demand only. Some regions have slightly higher generation capacities which are used to compensate for transmission losses between regions. The transmission pattern does not change as strongly because transmission remains crucial to balance renewable fluctuations. However, transmission hot spots are much less pronounced as transmission is distributed more homogeneously. National- and especially regional-scale supply thus lead to higher regional equity in terms of generation and transmission infrastructure.

In entirely small-scale systems, when regional electricity systems are fully self-sufficient and thus isolated, regional generation infrastructure equity is highest, but system cost varies strongly between regions, depending on the available renewable resources ({@fig:map-cost}b). About 10% of regions (and a few countries) have cost below the European average of the continental-scale baseline (blue regions in @fig:map-cost). These regions cover 40% or more of their peak demand with low-cost hydropower, which we assume is fully depreciated, with only O&M cost in our model (see Methods).

![**Spatial distribution of system cost normalised by demand for entirely national- and regional-scale systems, relative to the European average of the least-cost, entirely continental-scale case.** Each panel shows the Europe-wide relative system cost beneath the panel heading. **a**, Relative system cost for each country in the entirely national-scale system without any exchange of electricity between countries. **b**, Relative system cost for each region in the entirely regional-scale system without any exchange of electricity between regions.](report/map-cost.png){#fig:map-cost .class}

Another 10% of regions have cost at least twice those of the least-cost European average, and for half of them, cost is at least four times higher. These expensive regions have either excessively large (existing) hydropower capacities, or low or no potential for wind power.

Because we force hydropower capacities to exist where they exist today (see Methods), regions with hydropower generation greatly exceeding local demand have high supply cost due to high fixed cost for operation and maintenance. This is the case for several mountainous and rural regions, in the Alps (e.g. Grisons, Valais, Valle d’Aosta) but also elsewhere, such as Nikšic in Montenegro or Jämtland in Sweden. This is an artefact of our regional-scale analysis: these large hydro capacities were built to power nations, not small, sparsely populated parts of these countries (see Supplemental Note 3 for a discussion of the impact of our hydropower model choices on our results).

Several regions, mainly city regions like Geneva, Prague, Budapest, and Bucharest, have low or no potential for wind power and thus their main source of electricity is the sun. As solar generation has strong seasonal fluctuations in Europe, these regions require more flexible generation from bioenergy or hydropower, or long-term electricity storage to cover winter demand. Where the potentials for wind are low, the cost of providing flexibility, and thus system cost, is particularly high.

# Technology cost drives relative attractiveness of scales

Above (Figures\ @fig:cost-uncertainty and @fig:composition-uncertainty), we showed how the qualitative differences between scales are robust to input uncertainty. Nevertheless, uncertainties in model inputs affect both the cost and system design in all cases. Through a global sensitivity analysis, we find that the uncertainties of three input parameters explain by far most of the uncertainty in cost and design differences between entirely continental- and national-scale systems: discount rate, overnight cost of bioenergy, and overnight cost of onshore wind power (@fig:sobol). Uncertainties regarding the other parameters hardly affect our results. Because we use a different sensitivity analysis method on the regional scale compared to the national and continental scales (see Methods) we cannot analyse sensitivities of scale differences involving the regional scale (see Figures\ S2, S3, and S4 for sensitivities on all scales).

![**Total Sobol' indices for combinations of all considered input uncertainties (x-axis) and output differences between entirely continental- and national-scale systems (y-axis).** The total Sobol' indices determine the magnitude with which the variability of one model input explains the variability of one model output given assumptions on input variability. The x-axis shows the twelve input parameters included in the uncertainty analysis, sorted by their impact on system cost. The y-axis shows the model-wide result variables for which continental to national scale differences are compared. See Table\ S1 for a detailed compilation of all considered input uncertainty. See Figures\ S2, S3, and S4 for total Sobol' indices, first-order Sobol' indices, and the difference thereof, for all relevant model outputs on all three scales.](report/total-sobol-diff.svg){#fig:sobol .class}

Entirely national-scale systems become relatively more cost-attractive when discount rate or overnight cost of onshore wind power is high. High discount rates lead to high cost of transmission lines due to their long lifetime. Similarly, high wind power cost causes lower deployment of wind capacity and therefore reduced usefulness of transmission lines. Consequently, a cost-optimised continental-scale system contains less transmission capacity in these cases and in fact resembles national-scale systems more closely. Cost and design differences between the continental and national cases decrease. In contrast, when cost of bioenergy is high, national-scale systems become relatively less cost-attractive, as seasonal fluctuations are more pronounced on the national scale, and generally bioenergy is the least-cost option to balance them. Increases in cost of bioenergy thus increases total system cost of the national-scale systems more strongly than cost of the continental case. All three parameters do not change the qualitative relationship between geographic scale, cost, and design, but they do change the magnitude with which costs and designs differ across scales.

# Discussion and conclusions

We show that European renewable electricity systems on larger geographic scales always have lower cost, especially as they have more flexibility options available to balance fluctuating supply, but that small-scale supply can be designed to have only small cost penalties by allowing continental-scale balancing. Regionally self-sufficient systems have high cost, mainly because they cannot access the grid and dispatchable resources elsewhere for balancing. This is why regional net self-sufficient systems, which supply their own electricity but trade with other regions and countries for balancing, have low cost: the fluctuations are smoothed via the grid, and they can access dispatchable resources outside their own territory. Hence, a continental-scale renewable electricity system is the least-cost option, but regional-scale supply can also be low cost, if allowing for continental-scale balancing.

This means that large and small systems need not differ much in cost, but they differ strongly in system structure and the infrastructure requirements making land-use and the physical appearance important trade-offs to geographic scale. Using the transmission grid for continental-scale supply, i.e.  transmitting electricity from Europe’s best resources to demand centres, has the lowest cost but requires large transmission capacities of up to four times today’s transmission grid. Using the transmission grid for continental-scale balancing of net self-sufficient regional supply, in contrast, requires much less transmission capacity --- roughly the size of today’s transmission system. Regional-scale supply, however, has much higher generation capacity needs than continental-scale supply, and all of this generation is necessarily located near demand centres and cities, where pressure on land is already high. Hence, by scaling the European electricity system on the supply and balancing side independently, very different renewable electricity system designs are possible. While systems with continental-scale balancing all have similar costs, they differ strongly regarding how much and where transmission and generations assets are needed.

By applying a multi-fidelity sparse polynomial chaos expansion to our high-resolution electricity system model, we show that the findings are unaffected by the input parameter uncertainty we consider. However, the cost outlook for specific technologies influences the relative cost differences between larger-scale and smaller-scale systems. Two aspects which our analysis does not consider may make small-scale systems more cost-attractive. First, additional flexibility deriving from electrifying the heat and mobility sectors could reduce the cost of flexibility, which in our model is particularly high on small scales. Second, ancillary services that must be provided locally could limit the otherwise unrestricted spatial deployment on the continental scale. Both aspects have the potential to reduce cost differences between systems designed for different scales. For a detailed discussion of the effects, see Supplemental Note 4.

We show that fully renewable electricity supply in Europe does not necessarily require vastly increased transmission capacities, contradicting recent statements and views[@Joskow:2019]. By allowing regional-scale supply systems to balance supply within a continental grid, their cost penalty is reduced to 20% above the least-cost, continental-scale supply but without the need for large transmission expansion. We further show that a fully renewable electricity supply is possible not only in continent-spanning designs, as past work has shown[@Bussar:2014; @Schlachtberger:2017; @Horsch:2017a; @Jacobson:2017; @Zappa:2019], but also on the national and regional scales. While cost and total generation capacity are higher on smaller scales, they are likely not so high as to be economically infeasible, and these higher costs allow system operators to avoid transmission capacity expansion. Our results show how system cost of fully renewable electricity systems depend strongly on the balancing scale, but not as much on the supply scale, and that transmission needs can be traded off against generation capacity requirements. Thus, we show that very different system designs are possible, from the very small and regional to the very large and continental. It is important that policymakers and societies decide which type of system they find most attractive, in the knowledge that only one or the other can be built and that countries and citizens must accept either generation or transmission infrastructure for a transition to a fully renewable future in Europe to be feasible.

# Experimental procedures

We model a possible future European electricity system as a set of network nodes and power flows between the nodes, with each node representing a regional administrative unit in Europe. We consider the deployment of renewable electricity supply and storage technologies at each node, and the deployment of transmission links between nodes, but disregard subordinate network nodes and power flows on the distribution system. With the exception of hydro run-of-river, hydro reservoir, and pumped storage hydro plants, we do not consider current legacy generation capacities or the current topology of the transmission system. Thus our model represents almost entirely a greenfield system. We use this approach in order to understand the effect of system scale and size irrespective of the influence of legacy generation.

Using the Calliope model framework[@Pfenninger:2018b], we build a linear programming model that simultaneously optimises electricity system design and operation for a single weather year, 2016, with a temporal resolution of four hours. We choose a single year to reduce problem size, but we test this choice by also modelling the weather years 2007--2016 in a sensitivity analysis (see below). The objective function of the model is to find the design with the lowest total system cost. An electricity system design is defined by a set of supply capacities at each node, storage capacities at each node, and transmission capacities between all nodes. All system designs fulfilling Kirchhoff’s law, the technical constraints of all possible technology components, and political constraints (see below) are possible. We assume that electricity generation from photovoltaics, on- and offshore wind, and hydropower plants can be curtailed, i.e. the model can decide to lower actual generation at a certain point in time from the maximum generation given by the capacity factor time series described below.

The model code and all analysis steps are publicly available as a reproducible Snakemake[@Koster:2012] workflow <mark>(for review process provided within submission)</mark>. While the following text describes the modelling choices and assumptions made, the entirety of the model and all embedded assumptions are available for inspection through the repository linked to above.

## Geographic scope and transmission grid

The study area comprises all countries represented by member organisations in the ENTSO-E: the EU-28, Norway, Switzerland, and Western Balkan countries. We exclude Iceland which is electricity autarkic, Cyprus, which is not directly connected to the rest of the study area, and Malta, for which insufficient data are available. We divide the study area into 497 regional administrative units[@Trondle:2019], each of which is considered to be a transmission network node. We model the transmission grid as direct net transfer capacities between network nodes, i.e. we consider net power flows on the shortest distances between nodes only, and assume the distribution network within each node is able to handle distribution load. We allow transmission capacities between regional administrative units sharing a land border. We use currently existing sea connections and those that are currently under construction to connect regions that do not share a land border[@ENTSO-E:2019a]. We furthermore connect the islands Hiiu and Saare to the Estonian mainland, resulting in a fully connected electricity network graph as visible in Figure\ S5.

## System scale

We use two types of geographic scale as the basis for our system layouts. First, the scale of the electricity supply, and second, the scale of balancing of supply. Electricity supply on the continental, national, or regional scale requires that the entire continental, national, or regional electricity demand is satisfied annually with local electricity generation from wind, sun, biomass, and water. Within a year, electricity can be traded freely, as long as net annual imports reach 0.

We model the balancing scale by prohibiting electricity transmission between units on that scale. For national and regional scales this means that no electricity can flow between countries or regions. For the continental scale, this is given inherently by the scope of our study area.

## Electrical load

We determine electrical load profiles for each regional administrative unit following the method described in @Trondle:2019. First, we derive the location and annual demand of industrial facilities with highest electricity demand in Europe from emission data of the European Emission Trading Scheme[@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2018]. We assume industrial load to be nearly constant and thus derive flat industry profiles for each regional administrative unit.

Second, we use measured national load profiles of 2016[@Muehlenpfordt:2019] (for Albania no 2016 data is available and thus we use 2017 data) and subtract industrial demand to retrieve national profiles of residential and commercial load. We then assume residential and commercial load to be spatially distributed proportional to population counts. Using the Global Human Settlement Population Grid with a resolution of 250\ m[@JRC:2015] we allocate residential and commercial load to regional administrative units.

Finally, we sum the two industrial and residential time series in each administrative unit to retrieve electricity load profiles at each network node.

## Photovoltaics

Photovoltaics (PV) can be built at each network node. For each administrative unit, we first determine the maximum amount of capacity that can be deployed. Then, we determine the capacity factor time series which maps from installed capacity to electricity generation at each point in time.

Our model differentiates between PV deployed on open fields and on roof tops and uses geospatial data with a 10 arcsecond resolution. We allow open field PV to be built on areas of bare land[@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010] or open vegetation[@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010] that are not environmentally protected[@UNEP-WCMC:2018], not inhabited (i.e. < 1% of the grid cell are buildings or urban greens according to @Ferri:2017), and whose average slope[@Reuter:2007; @Danielson:2011] is 10° at maximum[@AlGarni:2018]. We assume a capacity density of 80\ W/m^2^ to derive the maximum amount of installable open field PV capacity for all regional administrative units.

To determine the maximum installable capacity of roof mounted PV, we consider inhabited areas only (i.e. ≥ 1% of the grid cell are buildings or urban green areas according to @Ferri:2017). Within those grid cells, we use building footprints from @Ferri:2017 as a proxy for the amount of available roof tops. Using the high-resolution Sonnendach.ch data set for Switzerland[@SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018], we find that within Switzerland, the ratio between building footprints from @Ferri:2017 and rooftops available for PV deployment is 0.56. Due to the lack of comparable data for other countries, we apply this ratio for all of Europe to derive the maximum amount of roof space available for PV. We further differentiate between roof space on flat roofs and on tilted roofs based on the ratio from @SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018 and assume capacity densities of 160\ W/m^2^ for tilted roofs and 80\ W/m^2^ for flat roofs.

We derive capacity factor time series for roof mounted and open-field PV on a regular grid with 50\ km edge length, resulting in around 2700 time series covering the study area. We assume a performance ratio of 90% and simulate the time series using Renewables.ninja[@Staffell:2016; @Pfenninger:2016]. For roof mounted PV, because tilt and orientation of tilted roofs have a significant impact on capacity factors, we model 16 different deployment situations covering roofs facing east, south, west, and north, with tilts between 18° and 43°. We calculate a weighted average from the resulting 16 time series based on the distribution of roofs from @SwissFederalOfficeofEnergy:2018 to derive a single time series for roof mounted PV for each 50\ km grid cell. For open field PV we optimise the tilt based on location[@Jacobson:2018], so each 50\ km grid cell has a single time series. By computing the weighted spatial average across grid cells whose centroid lies within a given administrative unit, we finally compute a single open field PV and a single roof mounted PV time series for each administrative unit.

## Wind on- and offshore

Onshore and offshore wind capacities can be deployed at each network node, and we apply a method similar to the one for photovoltaics to derive their maximum amount of installable capacities and their capacity factor time series.

We use geospatial data with 10 arcsecond resolution to derive the maximum amount of installable wind power capacities. We allow onshore wind farms to be built on areas with farmland, forests, open vegetation, and bare land[@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010] that are not environmentally protected[@UNEP-WCMC:2018], not inhabited (i.e. < 1% of the grid cell are buildings or urban greens according to @Ferri:2017), and whose average slope[@Reuter:2007; @Danielson:2011] is 20° at maximum[@McKenna:2015]. We allow offshore wind farms to be built in offshore areas within Exclusive Economic Zones[@Claus:2018] with water depths[@Amante:2009] not below 50\ m and which are not environmentally protected[@UNEP-WCMC:2018]. We assume capacity densities of 8\ W/m^2^ and 15\ W/m^2^[@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency:2009] for onshore and offshore wind. Where land is available for onshore wind farms and open field PV, either technology or a mix of both technologies can be used. We allocate the installable offshore capacities to those administrative units which share a coast with the Exclusive Economic Zone, and where there is more than one region, we allocate the capacities proportional to the length of the shared coast. We do not explicitly model the transmission network expansion needed to connect offshore farms.

We derive capacity factor time series for on- and offshore wind on the same 50\ km^2^ grid as we do for PV, resulting in around 2700 onshore grid cells and around 2800 offshore grid cells. We again use Renewables.ninja[@Staffell:2016; @Pfenninger:2016] to simulate wind generation at each grid cell, assume capacity factors to be constant within the cell, and generate a spatially weighted average to generate a capacity factor time series for each regional administrative unit.

## Hydro run-of-river and reservoirs

We assume hydro run-of-river and hydro reservoir potentials to be largely tapped today[@LacalArantegui:2014] with almost no expansion potential. Thus, for hydro generation capacities we deviate from the greenfield approach and fix today's capacities.

We derive the location and installed power and storage capacities of hydro stations in Europe today from the JRC Hydro Power Database[@MatteoDeFelice:2019]. Where no storage capacity of hydro reservoirs is available, we use the median national ratio of power to storage capacity, and if that is not available, we use the median Europe-wide ratio of power to storage capacity.

To create power generation time series for each station, we use a two-stage approach. First, we derive water inflow time series for each station using an approach based on ERA5 runoff data[@Dee:2011] and hydrological basins[@Lehner:2013] described and validated for China in[@Liu:2019]. We use Atlite[@Andresen:2015] to first determine all basins upstream of the hydropower station to be able to sum all upstream runoff while assuming a water flow speed of 1\ m/s.

Second, we apply bias correction factors based on annual generation necessary for this method to represent the actual magnitude of the inflow and thus accurately model power generation. As we do not have data per station, we use national generation data from IRENA[@IRENA:2018a]. For hydro run-of-river plants we assume constant annual capacity factors within each country, which allows us to estimate the annual generation per plant. We use this estimation to derive electricity generation time series for each plant by scaling and capping the water inflow time series such that they sum to the annual generation without ever exceeding power capacities of the stations. For hydro reservoirs, we additionally assume they never need to spill water, i.e. their storage capacity is sufficient to use all inflowing water. We then scale the water inflow time series in such a way that they sum to the annual generation of the stations.

Using location data of each plant, we sum up time series as well as power and storage capacities per regional administrative unit. Our total resulting capacities are 36\ GW for run-of-river and 103\ GW / 97\ TWh for reservoirs.

## Bioenergy

We use estimations of biomass potentials for the year 2020 and reference assumptions taken from @RuizCastello:2015, but we assume no dedicated farming for energy crops and thus consider residuals and wastes only. The data is given as national aggregates, and we use national shares of farmland[@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010], national shares of forests[@EuropeanSpaceAgency:2010], and national shares of population[@JRC:2015] as proxies to derive proportionally allocated potentials per regional administrative unit. Table\ S4 lists all feedstocks we consider together with the allocation proxy we use.

We assume an efficiency of 45% for the combustion of all biomass.

## Pumped storage hydro

Similar to hydro run-of-river and hydro reservoir capacities, we assume pumped storage hydro capacities in Europe to be largely tapped[@LacalArantegui:2014] and do not allow for capacity expansion. Thus, we deploy today's pumped hydropower and storage capacities. We assume a round-trip electricity efficiency of 78%[@Schmidt:2019].

To determine location, power and storage capacity of each pumped hydro station in Europe today, we also use the JRC Hydro Power Database[@MatteoDeFelice:2019]. Where storage capacities are missing, we employ the same method as for hydro reservoirs: we assume national median ratios of power to storage capacity for all stations with missing storage capacity; and where this is not available, we assume Europe-wide median ratios of power to storage capacity. The storage capacities from the JRC Hydro Power Database sum up to more than 10\ TWh, which is an order of magnitude above the 1.3\ TWh reported by @Geth:2015. To ensure that we do not overestimate the pumped storage potential we therefore scale storage capacities to match national data reported by @Geth:2015. Using location data of each station, we then sum all power and storage capacities within regional administrative units to form a single pumped hydro capacity per unit.

## Short-term and long-term storage

We assume that short-term and long-term storage capacities can be deployed in all regional administrative units. We model short-term storage as Lithium-ion batteries and assume long-term storage is provided by hydrogen, as they are likely to become the dominant technology in their respective applications[@Schmidt:2019]. The models are based on two technical parameters: the ratio between power and storage capacity, and the round-trip efficiency. Short-term storage is constrained to a maximum capacity of 4\ h of full power, while long-term storage has a minimum of 4\ h capacity at full power. We assume 86% of round-trip efficiency for short-term and 40% for long-term storage.

Additionally, we assume that power and storage capacities can be expanded independently, constrained only by the above mentioned minimum and maximum storage capacities.

## Insufficient potentials

In some regions, local technical potential for renewable electricity is not high enough to satisfy local electricity demand[@Trondle:2019]. This is problematic in system layouts in which regions strive for self-sufficiency. To provide sufficient electricity supply in these regions, we connect them with a neighbouring or the encompassing region: Vienna with Lower Austria, Brussels with Flanders, Berlin with Brandenburg, Oslo with Akershus, and Basel-City with Basel-Country. For the regional-scale system, but also for continental- and national-scale systems with regional self-sufficiency, we therefore require self-sufficiency of each combined region in these five corner cases.

## Technology cost

We assess the long term (quasi steady state) cost of electricity supply. We aim neither to determine the cost of a transition to a future system nor to consider disruptive developments on the global market for supply and storage technologies. Thus, our cost are based on expected learning rates and the assumption that renewable generation and electricity storage technologies will have been deployed at cumulative capacities consistent with our study. Cost estimates for the year 2050 are primarily from[@JRC:2014] for supply and transmission technologies, from[@Schmidt:2019] for storage technologies, and from[@RuizCastello:2015] for fuel cost of bioenergy. See Table\ S5 for an overview of all cost assumptions.

Technology cost is modelled as the sum of overnight capacity cost, annual maintenance cost based on installed capacity, and variable cost per unit of generated electricity. For solar and wind we assume a small variable cost of 0.1\ €ct / kWh to encourage curtailment whenever generation potential is higher than demand and storage capacities. We subtract these variable cost from the fixed operation and maintenance cost based on average capacity factors, so that they do not increase the overall cost of solar or wind technologies. For all hydropower technologies, we consider annual maintenance and variable cost only, since we assume that maximum capacities are already built today, so overnight cost of hydropower has no impact on our results.

Technology lifetime and cost of capital are used to derive annuities for each technology. We assume cost of capital to be 7.3% for all technologies and all locations based on historic average cost of capital for OECD countries[@Steffen:2019]. Some recent literature suggests cost of capital are likely specific to technology[@Egli:2018; @Steffen:2019] and location[@Ondraczek:2015; @Steffen:2019], but we consider the data available so far too sparse to provide a solid basis on which to model this.

## Sensitivity to meteorological conditions

While we use only a single year of meteorological conditions, 2016, in the analysis of system layouts described in the article, we use ten years, 2007--2016, to analyse the sensitivity of our results to meteorological conditions impacting generation from wind and solar power. We keep all other factors, including time series for electricity demand and hydropower, fixed. We re-run the model with the full ten years of data considered for the optimisation. In this way, we are not assessing the variability between meteorological years, but we are assessing how much the result changes when considering a wider range of meteorological conditions.

We are interested in the sensitivity of one of the main outputs of our study: relative total system cost of the national-scale system using the continental-scale system as a baseline. Because computational requirements to solve a model with regional spatial resolution and temporal resolution of 4h for ten years are too high, we perform this sensitivity analysis using a model with national spatial resolution while keeping temporal resolution the same. Comparing the results between national and regional resolution for the case with only one year of meteorological conditions, we find a difference of 8% for the relative cost of the national-scale system.

The additional cost of the national-scale system compared to the continental-scale system, however, is unaffected by the longer time duration: the difference to the case with only one year is negligible (< 1‰). This is not to say that cost and design of the electricity system is not sensitive to meteorological conditions. In fact, we find that total system cost is generally slightly higher, and more wind and bioenergy capacities are deployed in exchange of solar capacities. However, large-scale and small-scale systems are impacted similarly and so the difference between both is unaffected by the longer time duration of considered meteorological conditions. These results justify the use of only a single meteorological year.

## Sensitivity to technology cost

We furthermore assess the uncertainty of our results stemming from uncertainty of technology cost. While we do know current cost and we do know it is likely to fall with deployment due to learning effects, we do not know exact future cost with certainty. This uncertainty stems primarily from two sources. We do not know the deployment rates of renewable technologies and we do not know how much cost will fall with deployment. In our analysis, we are assuming that renewable technologies are heavily deployed, so we focus on the second uncertainty: the relationship between deployment and cost reductions. Since we perform cost minimisation, the absolute total system cost of any assessed electricity system layout can be sensitive to the cost of its constituent technologies, as shown for example in @Moret:2017.

We assess the sensitivity of differences in system cost and technology deployment between large and small-scale system layouts. We consider as uncertain parameters the cost of ten different technologies, the weighted cost of capital, and the availability of biomass for combustion. Following a maximum entropy approach, we model their uncertainty with uniform distributions over ranges taken from the literature (see Table\ S1). We perform a global sensitivity analysis of system cost and several other model outputs in this twelve dimensional space. This allows us to derive the distribution of each model output and it allows us to derive total and first-order Sobol' indices. The Sobol' indices determine the share of the variation of each output that is explained by the variation of each input. Building on this, we use the indices to rank input parameters based on their importance for the uncertainty of each output.

To derive the output distribution and Sobol' indices, we need to let parametric uncertainty propagate into and through the model. In a classical Monte Carlo simulation, the input distributions are sampled many times to derive samples of the output. Because of the high computational requirements, in particular the time our model takes to run, this approach would be prohibitive for our study. Thus, we employ a method described in refs. @Sudret:2008 and @LeGratiet:2017 to perform a polynomial chaos expansion of our original model to derive a surrogate model. We use the MATLAB package UQLab[@Marelli:2014]. From this surrogate model, Sobol' indices can be determined analytically and the distribution of the outputs can be derived using Monte Carlo sampling. We derive the surrogate model by sampling 150 times from the input parameters using maximin Euclidean-distance-optimised Latin Hypercube Sampling, and by running continental-, national-, and regional-scale models each once for each input parameter vector. Due to the high computational requirements of running national- and continental-scale models, we perform these runs on a spatial resolution with low fidelity in which each country represents one transmission grid node. To remove the biases these low fidelity model runs inhibit, we perform 10 additional runs on the original, high-fidelity resolution and use a multi-fidelity approach[@Palar:2016] to retrieve a single surrogate model for continental and national scales. The estimated empirical error of the surrogate model is below 5% and thus we deem the surrogate sufficiently accurate[@LeGratiet:2017] to derive total- and first-order Sobol' indices.
