    The European potential for renewable electricity is sufficient to enable fully renewable supply on different scales, from self-sufficient, subnational regions to an interconnected continent. We show that a continental-scale system is cheapest, but also that systems on the national scale and below are possible at cost penalties of 20% or less. Transmission is key to low cost, but it is not necessary to vastly expand the transmission system. When electricity is transmitted only to balance fluctuations, the transmission grid size is comparable to today’s albeit with expanded cross-border capacities. The largest differences across scales concern land use and thus social acceptance: in the continental system, generation capacity is concentrated on the European periphery where the best resources are. Regional systems, in contrast, have more dispersed generation. The key trade-off is therefore not between geographic scale and cost, but between scale and the spatial distribution of required generation and transmission infrastructure.
context-and-scale: |
    Transitioning to fully renewable electricity in Europe requires at least four to five times more solar and wind generation capacity than the continent hosts today. Where exactly all this infrastructure should be built is controversial. Options range from a continental-scale system with access to Europe’s best renewable resources to small-scale locally sufficient systems.

    We analyse how system cost and infrastructure requirements change with system scale. We find that continental supply has lowest cost and requires less generation infrastructure than smaller-scale supply. However, it requires a large expansion of the transmission grid. While supply scale is not the main cost driver, the scale at which balancing of variable renewable generation takes place is critical for cost: continental-scale balancing leads to low-cost electricity. The key trade-off for European decision-makers is therefore not just between scale and cost but between supply scale and infrastructure requirements.
eTOC: |
    We show that fully renewable electricity supply in Europe is cheapest when supply happens on the continental scale, but that national- or subnational supply is possible at cost penalties of 20% or less. Such low-cost electricity requires continental-scale balancing of renewable fluctuations and an expansion of cross-border transmission capacities, but not a large transmission grid overall. Infrastructure requirements vary strongly between supply on different scales and thus the key trade-off is between infrastructure requirements and scale.
highlights:
    - Continent-wide renewable electricity supply is cheapest but needs large grid expansion.
    - Small-scale supply has only 20% higher cost but needs more generation infrastructure.
    - On all supply scales, expanding cross-border transmission is necessary for low cost.
    - Key trade-off is between geographic scale and infrastructure requirements.
