    The European potential of renewable electricity is sufficient to enable fully renewable supply on different scales, from self-sufficient, subnational regions to an interconnected continent. We show that a continental-scale system is cheapest, but also that systems on the national scale and below are possible at cost penalties of 20% or less. The key to low cost is transmission, but it is not necessary to vastly expand the transmission system. When electricity is transmitted only to balance fluctuations, its size is comparable to today’s albeit with expanded cross-border capacities. The largest differences across scales concern land use and thus social acceptance: in the continental system, generation capacity is strongly concentrated on the European periphery where the best resources are. Regional systems, in contrast, have more dispersed generation. The key trade-off is therefore not between geographic scale and cost, but between scale and the spatial distribution of required generation and transmission infrastructure.
context-and-scale: |
    A transition to fully renewable electricity requires at least four to five times more solar farms and wind turbines than exist today in Europe. Where exactly all this infrastructure should be built is controversially debated: whether it should be in a continental-scale system with access to Europe’s best renewable resources, or in small-scale systems that can be driven by local initiatives.

    We analyse how system cost and infrastructure requirements change with system scale. We find that continental supply has indeed lowest cost and requires fewer generation infrastructure than smaller-scale supply but requires a large expansion of the transmission grid. While supply scale does not drive cost much, handling renewable fluctuation on the continental scale is crucial for low-cost electricity. The key trade-off for European decision-makers is therefore not between scale and cost but between supply scale and infrastructure requirements.
eTOC: |
    We show that fully renewable electricity supply in Europe is cheapest when supply happens on the continental scale, but that national- or subnational supply is possible at cost penalties of 20% or less. Crucial for low-cost electricity is a continental handling of renewable fluctuations, which requires an expansion of cross-border capacities, but not a large transmission grid in total. Infrastructure requirements vary strongly between supply on different scales and thus the key trade-off is between infrastructure requirements and scale.
highlights:
    - Continent-wide electricity supply is cheapest but needs large grid expansion.
    - Small-scale supply has only 20% higher cost but needs more generation infrastructure.
    - On all supply scales, expanding cross-border transmission is crucial for low cost.
    - Key trade-off is between geographic scale and infrastructure requirements.
