# Code and data

The code and reproducible workflow used to perform this analysis is available online TODO ADD. Furthermore, the resulting data is available online as well TODO ADD.

caption: 'Installed capacities of solar (<i class="fas fa-sun"></i>), wind (<i class="fas fa-wind"></i>), bioenergy (<i class="fas fa-leaf"></i>), short-term (<i class="fas fa-battery-three-quarters"></i> short) and long-term storage (<i class="fas fa-battery-three-quarters"></i> long) and relative curtailment of solar, wind, and hydro power (<i class="fas fa-traffic-light"></i>) for all electricity system layouts without net imports into autarkic units. Each layout is characterised by the autarky scale (<i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i>), the maximum level of annual net imports into autarkic units (<i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>), and the geographic scale of the entire system (<i class="fab fa-connectdevelop"></i>). Each layout additionally contains fixed hydroelectricity capacities on their current locations: 36 GW run of river, 103 GW / 97 TWh reservoirs, and 54 GW / 1.3 TWh pumped hydro storage. {#tbl:overview-scenario-results-1 tag="S1"}'
